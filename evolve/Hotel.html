<title>Evolution's Hotel</title>
<H1>Evolutionary
Locations</H1>

We have found
an excellent hotel, never before used by an Eastercon. <B>The Radisson
Edwardian</B> is a 459 bedroom 5 star hotel near Heathrow, full of function
space, with comfortable rooms and plenty of car parking. Archon,
a Star Trek con held there recently, was a great success. The staff are
friendly and the facilities excellent. We particularly like the large
glass atrium with swimming pool. The hotel promises affordable meals and
drinks at pub, not hotel, prices.<P>

	Room rates, per person per
night, including full English Breakfast are: double or twin &#163;32,
triple &#163;28, single occupancy of a double room &#163;42. These rates
also apply during the previous and following week, if you fancy a longer
stay in London.<P>

<H3>Getting There</H3>
Heathrow is easy to reach
from all parts of the country. Coaches run from many towns directly to
the airport (including RailAir links from Reading and Woking) and
there's a courtesy bus to the hotel. The Underground from central London
takes about 40 minutes. Of course, access by air is easy! If you're
driving, the hotel is just off the A4 and near the M4.<P>

<H3>Getting
Around</H3>
Heathrow is also a good centre for visiting other places, if
you can drag yourselves away from the convention! Royal Windsor, Hampton
Court and Richmond Park are nearby, with the Chilterns and Oxford just
40 miles away. There's a nice pub around the back of the hotel. The
hotel's courtesy bus takes you back to Heathrow - which isn't the
gastronomic desert it's been reputed to be. Buses and tubes get you to
the west London villages: Teddington, Hammersmith, Hounslow and Ealing
(with the best fish & chip restaurant for miles around). It's also easy
to get to Southall, which has plenty of good Indian restaurants. Of
course, there's always central London, with museums, bookshops, the West
End, bookshops, restaurants, bookshops, pubs, and - oh, did we mention
the bookshops?<P>
