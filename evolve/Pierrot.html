<B>A Passion for Lord Pierrot</B> 
<P>
Colin Greenland
<P>
In the land of Anise, on the planet of Triax, it is the hour after
dinner. Lord Pierrot sits alone in his apartment, playing the
accordion. He reclines on a couch and plays a slow, sad tango.
A melancholy fit is upon him, for he remembers the past, the years
before he came into his inheritance.
<P>
He is thinking of other nights, nights of gaiety when he sauntered
with his comrades through yellow gardens on the moon, the same
moon that now shines on the lake, turning it the colour of fine
honey. On those nights he had not a care to his name, and the
songs he sang were merry. He was young then, Lord Pierrot, and
now he is old, as they reckon such things on the planet of Triax.
<P>
Lord Pierrot's whole apartment is most sumptuously appointed.
The furnishings are made of velvet, the floor of glossy yellow
hardwood imported all the way from Peru, on Earth. Splendid specimens
of the local wildlife decorate the walls, represented by their
severed heads. But tonight Lord Pierrot is not comforted by luxuries,
nor by the trophies of his skill in the slaughter. Tonight there
will be no comfort for him but in the arms of his paramour, Daphne
Dolores.
<P>
He will go to her now, this minute. He rises and tucks the accordion
under his arm, to entertain her, later, with some music. With
this thought he steps from his chamber into the shaft and goes
down, out of the front door into the stifling night.
<P>
Lord Pierrot crosses the lake by means of his little rowing boat.
The moon is bright. Tomorrow night, he thinks, it will be full.
Across the water he sees a light in the window of the lodge that
stands upon the other shore. Moon or no moon, that is his beacon,
his guiding star.
<P>
He moors below the lodge, in the lee of a black rock that shelves
out like a parapet over the water. The rock was brought back from
the Horsehead Nebula by Lord Pierrot's father, at a time when
society admired such actions. Lord Pierrot climbs upon it now
and stands gazing at the moonlit lodge. A languid breeze toys
with his pale hair.
<P>
In the silence he hears the door of the lodge open, and then he
sees her, sees Daphne Dolores, running to greet him.
<P>
&quot;Daphne Dolores!&quot; cries Lord Pierrot, and he springs
from the rock. At once she is in his arms. He holds her very tightly,
though not inconsiderately. He feels the beating of her heart,
that splendid organ. Its rhythm betrays only a slight sign of
exertion -- or is that passion, passion for Lord Pierrot?
<P>
&quot;Daphne Dolores,&quot; murmurs Lord Pierrot ardently. &quot;My
love.&quot;
<P>
&quot;My darling,&quot; Daphne Dolores replies, in rapture.
<P>
Daphne Dolores is slight and becomingly small of stature. She
looks up at Lord Pierrot and presses the palm of her hand to his
breast in a way that he finds irresistible. Her blue eyes sparkle
in the moonlight. At this moment he would do anything for her,
anything she asked. At this moment he would give up his wife,
his house, his lands, his laboratories, and take her away on a
journey to another star, a journey to last a lifetime.
<P>
Fortunately, Daphne Dolores does not ask him to do so. She does
not ask him for anything. It is not in her nature to ask for things.
<P>
The most she will ever ask him is: &quot;Are you pleased to see
me?&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot is inflamed with love for her. He kisses her fiercely,
bearing down on her in his hunger for her lips.
<P>
She returns his kiss as avidly as he gives it her, Daphne Dolores.
<P>
Thus they remain, a minute or more, as they reckon these things
on Triax.
<P>
Then they enter the lodge, and close the door upon the night.
<P>
Lord Pierrot bids his darling extinguish the lamp that guided
him across the lake. He prefers darkness for these meetings. He
does not like to let Daphne Dolores see his face too clearly,
for it will remind her that he is old, and remind him too of what
she is.
<P>
She is a young woman, Daphne Dolores.
<P>
She obeys him in this request, as in all things, and returns to
him at once.
<P>
Lord Pierrot is solicitous. He pays full attention to the woman
in his arms. He must not waste an instant of her company. He kisses
her again, hungrily, as if he could somehow suck new youth from
her mouth.
<P>
Daphne Dolores makes a small noise in her throat. Her hand presses
the back of his neck as they kiss.
<P>
Her love for him is complete and true. Lord Pierrot knows that
of her. He knows it so well that he no longer reflects on it.
It is not in her nature to love a man and afterwards, cease from
loving him.
<P>
Lord Pierrot rolls up his ruffled sleeves, pushing them back from
his long, slender wrists. His hands are narrow, his fingers taper.
He wears a ring with a large, square, black stone. He wears it
at all times, and never takes it off, not even with a woman. He
has excused it to them, to Daphne Dolores and to all those who
came before her, as a sentimental attachment, a betrothal gift
from his wife.
<P>
Lord Pierrot begins to undress Daphne Dolores.
<P>
She stands quietly on the rug as he reveals her body to the night.
<P>
Daphne Dolores is white and slim as a boy. Her hair is cut short,
and layered as closely to her head as the fur of an otter. Lord
Pierrot runs his hand over her hair and kisses her throat. She
shuts her eyes and lifts her chin with pleasure.
<P>
Her shoulders and hips are narrow, Daphne Dolores, her stomach
flat. She has no breasts to speak of. Her nipples look like wounds
in the dim light. It is scarcely conceivable now, but thus his
wife, Lady Dove, used to be, ah, long ago, in the first days of
their marriage. Lord Pierrot goes down on one knee to remove her
stockings. With his lips he brushes her pubic hair. He is consumed
with desire for her.
<P>
Rising, Lord Pierrot pulls at the buttons of his gown. Beneath
it he wears neither shirt nor undergarment. His chest is narrow
and hairless. He kisses Daphne Dolores as he tugs his arms from
the sleeves and forces down his baggy trousers.
<P>
His penis is slender, and elegantly curved. It lifts in the dark
like some strange nocturnal plant of Triax, seeking for the moon.
<P>
Lord Pierrot directs Daphne Dolores to take hold of it, and she
does. He gasps in pleasure.
<P>
Later, when pleasure has had its fill, Lord Pierrot lies back
against the pillows with Daphne Dolores nestling in the crook
of his arm. She lies lightly upon him, for which he is grateful,
for the night is very hot, and they are both somewhat sticky.
<P>
Up in the rafters, something catches Lord Pierrot's eye: a small
mass darker than the darkness. It is sure to be a nest of the
skylings, which persist in infesting his eaves. Every year at
this time it is necessary to send an automaton to pluck out the
nests of the skylings and cast them into the lake. These nights
Lord Pierrot shares with Daphne Dolores are numbered; they are
precious and few. The squawking of baby birds must not be permitted
to disturb the making of love.
<P>
&quot;You&quot;re very quiet, my love,&quot; says Daphne Dolores.
<P>
Lord Pierrot kisses the top of her head.
<P>
&quot;What are you thinking of?&quot; she asks him.
<P>
&quot;I&quot;m thinking of you, my delight,&quot; he tells her.
His voice is high, and quavers. It seems to lose all its virile
resonance after lovemaking. Lord Pierrot has remarked it before,
and wondered whether anything can be done about it. &quot;I&quot;m
thinking of you,&quot; he says. &quot;And how perfect you are.&quot;
<P>
It is a lame, trite answer, he knows. Nor is it altogether true.
Lord Pierrot is in fact thinking of his wife, Lady Dove, and wishing
she were away from home. But what a gross error of tact it would
be even to mention this to his mistress, as they lie together
in the afterglow of passion. Lord Pierrot is nothing if not fastidious.
It embarrasses him to utter falsehoods and platitudes, though
Daphne Dolores has an inexhaustible capacity to receive them.
She rejects nothing, not if Lord Pierrot gives it.
<P>
He gets out of bed, leaving her lying there. He finds his accordion
on the floor and, dusting it reverently with the palm of his hand,
remembers his plan to delight Daphne Dolores with a serenade or
two. He opens the door and sits there, on the step, looking out
at the night.
<P>
Now that he has drained the cup of passion dry, the melancholy
fit is upon him again. Lord Pierrot plays once more the slow,
sad tango.
<P>
&quot;What a mournful tune, my love!&quot; exclaims Daphne Dolores.
<P>
Lord Pierrot looks round at her, seeing only a dark shape in the
dark house, out of reach of the moonlight. The lodge is full of
the musky scent of her. Lord Pierrot lays his accordion aside.
<P>
&quot;Would you have me always happy?&quot; he asks her.
<P>
&quot;For my sake,&quot; she tells him.
<P>
&quot;Ah, that I might do everything for your sake,&quot; he muses,
sorrowfully. &quot;Then would you be mistress indeed.&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot wishes his wife might be sent away, just for a while,
before the end of summer. He has an aunt, in the north-west. She
and Lady Dove have always got on wonderfully well together. They
play bezique, and compare their illnesses.
<P>
While the accordion finishes its tango Lord Pierrot cups his chin
in his hands and watches the golden moon of Triax climb above
the trees along the lake shore. The heat blurs the sky about it
to the violet of a fresh bruise.
<P>
The moonlight creeps through the open door, finding Daphne Dolores
where she reclines, naked and pale on the tousled sheets. When
the instrument falls silent, Lord Pierrot speaks in Latin, telling
her that his melancholy is but natural, under the circumstances.
&quot;<U>Post coitum</U>,&quot; says Lord Pierrot, &quot;<U>omne
animal triste est</U>.&quot;
<P>
&quot;You have said that to me before,&quot; says Daphne Dolores.
&quot;I remember it. I wish I could be learned, and know such
things.&quot; &quot;So you could, my dear,&quot; replies Lord
Pierrot, &quot;so you could, if you would first grow to my age.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Oh, now you will complain of your years, and talk of decline
and the inadequacy of flesh,&quot; says Daphne Dolores at once,
protesting, though in gentle merriment. &quot;I shall not allow
you to remain in this mood,&quot; she declares, and she rises
from the bed and comes to him where he sits in the doorway. Stooping,
she embraces him from behind, stroking his cooling flesh and kissing
his ear and his neck until he begins to rouse again.
<P>
&quot;No, Daphne Dolores,&quot; says Lord Pierrot then, and with
a touch he deters her, disengaging her arms from about his neck.
He nods his long head in the direction of the lake. &quot;It is
time I returned to my lady.&quot;
<P>
At that Daphne Dolores casts herself upon him and clasps him to
her once again. &quot;Stay with me tonight,&quot; she pleads.
She twists her fine fingers into his soft white hair.
<P>
Lord Pierrot is surprised at her forwardness, though flattered
as any man would be. Usually she is more modest. He felicitates
himself for having roused a new passion in her tonight. Her love
for him, which he would have sworn was complete, is growing yet.
<P>
He detaches her hand from his hair and brings it to his lips.
&quot;Alas,&quot; he says. &quot;I may not. Women,&quot; he tells
her, &quot;are creatures of the heart; but men must bend the knee
to duty.&quot;
<P>
The truth is, that Lord Pierrot is grown old, as they reckon these
things on Triax, and amorous exertion, especially in the season
of heat, leaves him not only melancholy but also exhausted. But
this is neither the place nor the time for truth; only for the
voice of regret, in words of parting.
<P>
Bidding Daphne Dolores a gallant farewell, Lord Pierrot closes
the door of the lodge, straightens his cuffs, and steps carefully
in the dark down past the black rock to the sandy margin of the
lake. He goes to board the little boat that will take him back
to the shore.
<P>
It is a boon, Lord Pierrot's little boat, a device of his own
invention quite indispensable for these nocturnal trysts. As it
rows itself noiselessly across the honey-coloured water, Lord
Pierrot is able to take his ease and recoup some of his dissipated
energies. He looks around at the torpid, sultry night. In the
reeds not a lizardfish, not a dabchick is stirring. The whole
world, it seems, is still; still as if all Triax were barren,
and the secret ways of life not yet pieced together there.
<P>
Lord Pierrot congratulates himself on the satisfactory conclusion
of another night's dalliance.
<P>
Back indoors, Lord Pierrot sheds his clothes and hands them to
a waiting automaton, which trundles away to launder them. They
will be fresh and dry by morning. Belting a poplin robe about
him, Lord Pierrot steps into the shaft and allows it to carry
him up past the dining hall, past the libraries and laboratories,
to the upper floor where both he and his wife have their apartments.
<P>
He looks in on his wife, the Lady Dove. She is still awake. She
lies propped on a great many pillows, reading a volume of the
collected correspondence of a grande dame of another age. Here,
on this benighted outpost of the empire where the Pierrots keep
their family seat, few letters reach them, and Lady Dove must
make do with these printed relics.
<P>
She looks at him over her glasses. &quot;What time is it, Pierre?&quot;
<P>
She has her bedside console, and need only ask the house intelligence;
but she prefers to ask him. Lord Pierrot stifles his irritation,
making an effort to construe this habit of his wife's as deference
due to his authority in the household. He tells her it is half-past
eleven, or a quarter to one, however they reckon these things
on Triax. &quot;Time you were asleep, my dear,&quot; he tells
her, and pats her on the shoulder. Lady Dove needs a great deal
of sleep. She has grown colossally fat since he found it expedient
to remove her ovaries. The slightest exercise fatigues her.
<P>
&quot;And you, Pierre, are you not going to bed?&quot; she asks.
<P>
&quot;Directly, my angel,&quot; says Lord Pierrot; but first he
will stay and converse with her awhile, as is only mannerly. He
looks around for a chair, but they are all laden with clothing,
books and female impedimenta that Lady Dove has been too weary
to put away. Lord Pierrot averts his eyes from a pile of her enormous
underwear. He sits gingerly on the narrow margin of the bed that
is not occupied by the flesh of Lady Dove.
<P>
&quot;I have been taking a stroll in the grounds,&quot; he tells
her, &quot;by the light of the moon.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Moonlight is not good for the brain,&quot; declares his
wife at once. &quot;The radiance of the moon is unsettling. It
tends to unbalance one.&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot strokes her great hand consolingly. &quot;I find
it more calming these days than the heat of the sun,&quot; he
tells her mildly.
<P>
Lady Dove is full of opinions on what is and is not healthy. Her
capacity for them has grown as her bulk has swelled, and as her
own vitality has declined. This stricture against moonlight is
typical, mere feminine superstition. As a scientist, Lord Pierrot
would like to dispute it, but as long as he allows her to remain
in error, he can be sure Lady Dove will leave him to pursue his
nocturnal excursions uninterrupted, for fear of moonlight.
<P>
And Daphne Dolores knows never to come near the house. So all
is well.
<P>
He embarks on a trivial anecdote, the story of an amusing but
entirely logical error made by his automatic lepidopteron, which
has been unable to grasp the subtleties of Triacian taxonomy.
&quot;There it sat, solemnly mounting and labelling an entire
drawer of bluebottles!&quot;
<P>
Lady Dove lies like a torpid hippopotamus, breathing hoarsely
through her open mouth. Her heavy eyes never leave Lord Pierrot's
countenance, though he does not assume she is attending to his
anecdote. She is simply watching his mouth move. Meanwhile, covertly,
he is studying her. Unintentionally, automatically, he compares
her cumbersome flesh, her stale and suffocating bosom and lank
hair with the fragrant delights he has tasted so recently in the
arms of Daphne Dolores.
<P>
He remembers when he first set eyes on Lady Dove, at a gala concert
on Artemisia to celebrate the opening of the new Trans-Galactic
Passage. She was a delicate flower then, a rose in bud adorning
the arm of her papa, Lord Panteleone, while he was but a subaltern
in the ranks of science, a rising young buck of some promise in
the Innovation Corps. Now he is Lord Pierrot, master of the tango
and the heavy night, yearning madly for the moon.
<P>
&quot;You seem tired tonight, Pierre,&quot; says his wife. &quot;You
drive yourself too strenuously.&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot looks sharply at her. It would be unlike her, unworthy
of her, to resort to innuendo.
<P>
&quot;Science is a hard taskmaster,&quot; he replies, blandly.
&quot;I hope you are not overdoing it,&quot; she says. &quot;You
will make yourself ill.&quot; He thinks she sounds a trifle disgruntled,
but Lady Dove has returned her attention to her book. Lord Pierrot
bids her politely good night. He kisses her pendulous cheek, quickly,
and goes to his own room.
<P>
As he bids the intelligence turn out the light, a second poignant
memory occurs to him, unsought, of that time when Dove and he
made a foursome with Gerard Pomeroy and Mona Twisk to sample the
innocent pleasures of the gardens of the moon. Those golden days.
Behind the marshmallow kiosk his Dove had unbuttoned her glove
and, almost unprompted, relieved him of an importunate erection.
His astonishment and pleasure were alloyed, a little, with alarm
at her expertise. How could his dainty treasure be so knowledgeable
about the male organ? How did she know what to do? Not, thinks
Lord Pierrot to himself, that she had to do very much. In acts
of venery, he commends himself as he falls asleep, he has always
been prompt, very prompt.
<P>
Next morning, when Lord Pierrot awakes, he directs an automaton
to throw open the window. The green land of Anise lies veiled
in haze. This day promises to be just as hot as all its immediate
predecessors. The heat can affect a man, playing upon his blood.
Lord Pierrot thinks again of his memory of Dove, of her unexpected
dexterity. It is bitter to him now. When did he and his wife last
enjoy the pleasures of concupiscence? How many years is it since
he has seen beneath that billowing nightgown?
<P>
Lord Pierrot winces inwardly and turns away from these unhappy
reflections. Already he is suffused with longing for his paramour,
for Daphne Dolores. He must meet her again tonight. He orders
breakfast in the Magenta Room, with the french windows open onto
the terrace.
<P>
It is nearly an hour before Lady Dove makes her ponderous appearance.
She drops, panting, into her reinforced chair.
<P>
Lord Pierrot is courteous, even solicitous. He waves away the
butler hovering with its scalpel extended and cuts Lady Dove's
grapefruit himself.
<P>
&quot;My poor precious,&quot; he murmurs, &quot;how was your night?
Was it comfortable at all?&quot;
<P>
&quot;Not a bit,&quot; answers Lady Dove, and proceeds with a
catalogue of symptoms and grievances so anatomically detailed
that Lord Pierrot's disciplined scientific objectivity is almost
overborne. Swiftly passing beyond sympathy into squeamishness,
he withdraws his attention, and recovers equilibrium only by most
meticulously buttering a muffin.
<P>
&quot;I was thinking you might visit Aunt Penthesilea, my darling,&quot;
says Lord Pierrot, &quot;in the north-west. It is cooler there.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Your aunt is on a cruise,&quot; says Lady Dove. &quot;To
Percival's Star. She has gone to take the waters on Syringa. I
told you so. You never listen to me, never.&quot;
<P>
She mashes her grapefruit clumsily with a spoon.
<P>
Lord Pierrot looks at her in rising anger. His wife is being petulant.
She believes she is the one who should have been taken on a restorative
cruise to Syringa, as if that or any other fanciful &quot;therapy&quot;
might make any dent in the arsenal of her ailments.
<P>
Lord Pierrot regards his wife, her wet lips drooping over her
breakfast dish. He is on the point of retorting that he too could
wish her halfway across the galaxy; but he maintains his dignity.
&quot;What a shame,&quot; he says, and finishes his muffin in
three quick bites. Slender as he is, Lord Pierrot has always had
a robust appetite.
<P>
He attempts a new, neutral subject. &quot;The skylings will be
hatching any day now,&quot; he observes.
<P>
Suddenly, for no apparent reason, Lady Dove drops her spoon. It
falls from her fingers and clatters among the crockery. She gives
a small, convulsive quiver, but no sound.
<P>
To his horror, Lord Pierrot sees that she has begun to cry. There
she sits, silent and still as a great bolster, while tears well
up in her tiny eyes and slither down her mountainous face.
<P>
Embarrassed by this unprovoked effusion, Lord Pierrot blots his
lips hurriedly with his napkin and flees the table, leaving his
kedgeree almost untouched.
<P>
He spends the day in the laboratories, where his privacy is guaranteed.
While the brilliant primary of Triax moves pane by pane across
the stained glass windows, dappling the apparatus with rainbows,
Lord Pierrot tends his vats. They are coming along very nicely.
Suspended in their rich brown soup of nutrients, the fibrous lengths
of pale pink matter slowly twist and thicken.
<P>
In his laboratory Lord Pierrot is accustomed to be happy. He will
talk to his specimens, and fancies they reply, mutely, waving
their rosy fronds. He will sing to them: no melancholy tangos
here, but snatches of songs of love.
<P>
His homunculi gather chirping and chuckling around Lord Pierrot's
feet. They like to fetch him the curious, wriggling things they
trap behind the wainscot at night. On any other day one might
find them skipping along after as he glides from vat to vat with
flasks of concentrate and slips of litmus paper.
<P>
Alas, today his mood is quite ruined by this disgraceful display
of his wife's. To break down! at the breakfast table! And for
no reason at all.
<P>
Sensing their master's displeasure, the homunculi retreat, cowering
beneath the cabinets. Lord Pierrot slumps on the couch, fingering
his black ring.
<P>
At dinner that evening Lord Pierrot is relieved to find the table
laid for one. Lady Dove, the intelligence informs him, is indisposed.
She will dine in her room. There will be no need for him to attempt
polite conversation, to conduct relations with his wife as though
her shameful outburst of the morning had never happened. Instead
he can concentrate on the pleasures of the palette, a fitting
preliminary to the pleasures of other senses, other organs, he
will be shortly be enjoying in the company of Daphne Dolores.
<P>
Night falls swiftly in the land of Anise, on the planet of Triax.
The moon rises and blesses the park with its golden glaze. The
heat does not subside. It grows, if anything, more oppressive.
Thick clouds begin to mass in the sky.
<P>
Lord Pierrot lingers a moment on the terrace, breathing deeply
of the rich scents of hibiscus and false phlox. It is night, and
the melancholy fit is upon him. He gazes into space, remembering
other nights on other worlds, fresh, piquant worlds at the frontier
of science.
<P>
On his way through the hot gardens, Lord Pierrot composes a poem
on themes of ripeness and decay. Once he looks back towards the
house, and sees the light at his wife's bedroom window. He sighs.
<P>
A blundering sourmoth flies into his face, battering him with
its dusty great wings. Lord Pierrot brushes it aside without anger.
Tonight, nothing can disturb his mood. He is feeling acquiescent,
resigned to his age and the passing of time, accepting his place
in the grand scheme of Nature. He can afford to be magnanimous,
to his poor, suffering wife, and to the ignorant little creatures
of the dark and stifling night. He puts the sourmoth into his
poem.
<P>
Arrived, at last, at the lake, he summons his little boat and
rides out across the gilded water. He sees the light burning in
the window of the lodge, and yearns towards it. How he envies
the simple life that Daphne Dolores leads there. That, he decides,
is all one really wants: a lantern and a humble wooden bed; a
loaf of bread and an accordion. What need has an old man of more?
He could let all the rest go, the great house, the laboratories
and libraries with all their oppressive weight of ambition and
responsibility, history and posterity. True peace is to live simply,
in a little house by the water.
<P>
Lord Pierrot lands and climbs on his father's rock. He stands
with arms akimbo, looking towards the door of the lodge. He waits
for his paramour, Daphne Dolores. She always hears his boat and
comes running. He waits; but she does not come.
<P>
Something is wrong. Perhaps she is ill. Perhaps she has been stolen
away.
<P>
Lord Pierrot climbs down again from the rock. He goes to the lodge
and stands outside, listening at the door. Should he knock? At
the door of his own property? What if he does, and alerts some
brigand, some beast of prey lurking within, poised with fell intent
over the swooning form of his beloved?
<P>
Courageously Lord Pierrot reaches for the door and flings it open.
<P>
The lamp is burning, and she is there, Daphne Dolores, lying naked
on the bed. She is, as always, alone.
<P>
She smiles at him, a fetching smile. &quot;Welcome to my house,
Lord Pierrot,&quot; she says.
<P>
&quot;Daphne Dolores!&quot;
<P>
She reaches out her arms.
<P>
&quot;Come to me,&quot; she commands him.
<P>
Moving like one in a dream, he crosses to the bed and embraces
her. She clutches him in a grip of desire. How urgently she caresses
him. He hears her breathing shallow and quick. He feels her heart
pounding in her breast as if with an emotion too large for that
narrow cage.
<P>
&quot;Daphne Dolores, my treasure!&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot wonders if she is unwell.
<P>
Daphne Dolores laughs. &quot;Do you like my surprise?&quot;
<P>
&quot;But you are naked,&quot; he says. He feels a twinge of annoyance
at this: she knows it is always his pleasure to undress her when
they meet.
<P>
She sets him at arm's length and looks into his eyes.
<P>
&quot;I am pretending this is my house,&quot; she says. &quot;I
am mistress here. And you are <U>my</U> suitor.&quot;
<P>
Her manner is intense, Daphne Dolores, her eyes amused at his
discomfiture. Lord Pierrot has never seen her like this before.
<P>
&quot;I want you,&quot; she says. Her voice is deep, suddenly,
and thick with passion. &quot;Now.&quot;
<P>
She tears at his clothes, straining seams, snapping buttons from
their threads.
<P>
Lord Pierrot is alarmed. He tries to restrain her hands, but desire
lends her strength. She fights him, attacks his gown again. He
falls sprawling across the bed, laughing feebly. But he is not
amused. He is an old man, and not accustomed to such violent handling.
And from a woman! One of his women!
<P>
&quot;Gently, my pet!&quot; he cries. &quot;Gently!&quot;
<P>
She takes no notice. She lunges at him, throwing herself on top
of him and kissing him fiercely.
<P>
Something must be wrong with her. The heat has unhinged her. They
are such sensitive creatures.
<P>
Lord Pierrot pushes weakly at her, at Daphne Dolores, striving
to rise; but she pushes him in return, turning him over on his
back and clambering upon him. She grasps his baggy trousers, dragging
them off and hurling them into a corner.
<P>
This is not love, that sweet, sad, tender enchantment, Lord Pierrot
thinks to himself as she tears off his gown; this is brute lust!
What can he do? With all his women he has always been able to
retain control, even in the giddy toils of desire. Daphne Dolores
seems to have gone quite mad. Mad, it is true, with passion for
him, for Lord Pierrot; but mad nonetheless.
<P>
He is almost unmanned by dread, repelled by her undignified abandon.
Pinned beneath her writhing body, Lord Pierrot closes his eyes
and thinks of her as she has always been before: soft, tender,
yielding.
<P>
Daphne Dolores fastens her teeth in his nipple. Lord Pierrot cries
out in protest. But she laughs and twists around above him, seeking
every moment a new and more gratifying position.
<P>
Lord Pierrot thumbs his ring.
<P>
She sees him.
<P>
At once she rises up, straddling him in a way that makes him catch
his breath. She seizes his hand, and tugs at the ring.
<P>
&quot;My dear!&quot; gasps Lord Pierrot.
<P>
&quot;Off!&quot; she cries. &quot;Off with it!&quot;
<P>
&quot;No!&quot; He covers the ring with his hand.
<P>
Daphne Dolores pauses, looking down at him with a wrathful gaze.
&quot;I hate it. I hate everything that reminds me of her,&quot;
says Daphne Dolores.
<P>
&quot;It was never hers,&quot; Lord Pierrot says at once. &quot;What
I told you was untrue.&quot;
<P>
Daphne Dolores arches her brows. Her curiosity is piqued. She
keeps hold of his hand. She requires an explanation.
<P>
Glad of the respite from these exertions, Lord Pierrot gives her
one.
<P>
&quot;The ring was never a gift from Lady Dove,&quot; he says,
somewhat hoarsely. &quot;It is a family heirloom. A device of
my great-great-grandfather's. He was a man of many enemies.&quot;
<P>
With a flick of the secret hinge he shows her, concealed beneath
the square black stone, a needle steeped in a swift and fatal
poison. Concocted by the first wearer, that poison has been improved
by his subsequent heirs. Against it there is no appeal.
<P>
Lord Pierrot tells her of the apprehensions he suffered outside
her door. &quot;One sweep of my hand, my love, and there he would
lie, your assailant, paralysed and dying at your feet!&quot;
<P>
Daphne Dolores examines the ring, the needle beneath the stone.
<P>
&quot;And have you ever made use of it?&quot; she asks, speaking
low.
<P>
&quot;Experimentally,&quot; he tells her. &quot;On suitable local
creatures.&quot;
<P>
She laughs again. In her present mood such macabre prospects amuse
her. She flips shut the ring and, before he can prevent her, ducks
her head and lightly kisses the square black stone.
<P>
She looks at him from under lowered brows, her lips still touching
the ring.
<P>
&quot;On suitable creatures,&quot; she repeats.
<P>
Then she is upon him once more, and there is nothing he can do
while she has her way with him.
<P>
Lord Pierrot senses at last the stirring of desire. There is something
splendid, he recalls, about a woman towering over him thus, in
an access of hunger and power. Unnatural? Is it truly so? There
may be many things in Nature, he thinks; many hidden things. And
did not Lady Dove excite him thus when they were wed?
<P>
She reminds him, Daphne Dolores, of his wife when she was young.
They all do, all his women. He is prone, Lord Pierrot, to such
sentiments.
<P>
He thrusts into her with rekindled appetite. The old voluptuary
is not defeated yet.
<P>
But even while she grinds and rocks upon him, yelping and growling
like an animal in rut, the scientist in him considers: was there
no warning of this last night? No sign, no prior indication of
this unprecedented frenzy?
<P>
Lord Pierrot has always prided himself on the accuracy and good
order of his memory. Even as they rise together towards their
climax he recalls how Daphne Dolores disparaged his serenade,
and opposed him when he made reference to the melancholy matter
of his age. And yes, he remembers now how she revealed her hatred
for Lady Dove, trying to keep him from his lawful place beside
his invalid wife. She clutched him by the hair! And he thought
nothing of it!
<P>
It was love, Lord Pierrot understands as Daphne Dolores falls
upon him in her sensuous spasm. Love, that delusive, obliterating
passion: only love could make so experienced, so wise a man so
blind.
<P>
Daphne Dolores lies lathered and gasping on his chest. But Lord
Pierrot, he is not yet spent. He heaves at her, stroking distractedly
at her hair.
<P>
She lifts her head, Daphne Dolores, from under his hand. She lifts
her hips, and withdraws.
<P>
&quot;My love!&quot; cries Lord Pierrot, aghast.
<P>
She kneels up once more, straddling him, toying with him. Her
eyes are languid now, her movements satiated.
<P>
Yet he is not done, Lord Pierrot.
<P>
And nor, it seems, is she, Daphne Dolores.
<P>
She speaks. &quot;Take me up to the house,&quot; she says.
<P>
&quot;But my sweet!&quot;
<P>
She ignores his protest.
<P>
&quot;Take me to the house,&quot; she says again. &quot;Let me
be mistress there.&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot is astounded. This is absolutely counter to the first
rule, that she must never interfere in his domestic arrangements.
Daphne Dolores has abandoned all sense of place and propriety.
<P>
Then he smiles.
<P>
Is his spirit dead, his blood quite cold? Is he not still Lord
Pierrot, the libertine of Fomalhaut, the rakehell of the Innovators?
And is she not Daphne Dolores, creature of his passion?
<P>
He flings his arms about her slender waist. &quot;Yes, my love,
you are right. Let us be wild! Let us be free of trammelling checks
and consciences! Let us go where love bids!&quot; He chortles.
&quot;Oh, my darling, my <U>mistress</U>, I must say: how cunningly
you teach me!&quot;
<P>
Together the lovers scramble from the bed and out into the clouded
night. Barefoot and naked they run down to the rock where the
dependable little boat has moored itself. They climb aboard, Lord
Pierrot sitting astern with Daphne Dolores sprawled between his
shrunken thighs. He gives the command to steer for the shore.
<P>
As they ride, Lord Pierrot looks behind them. The moon is still
hidden, and all the stars.
<P>
He strokes the short, soft hair of Daphne Dolores. Perhaps she
will be calmer now, more docile since slaking her lust. No - -
she turns energetically in his arms, nuzzling forcefully at him,
almost upsetting the little boat.
<P>
&quot;Will you take me to the house?&quot; she asks again.
<P>
&quot;To the very heart of the house,&quot; he promises.
<P>
They cross the lake. Lord Pierrot passes by the boathouse and
puts ashore at the abandoned grotto. Leading Daphne Dolores by
the hand he scales the bank, and slips between the statues of
the Astral Graces, each of which wears his mother's face. Along
crazed paths, between straggling rhododendrons the couple hasten,
circumventing the garden by an obscure route that brings them
out at last on the croquet lawn. The east wing looms ahead, its
windows glittering darkly.
<P>
Suddenly Daphne Dolores stops. Lord Pierrot knows she remembers
his instruction, that she is never to come near the house itself.
She stands naked and panting on the croquet lawn, seeking her
lover's face in frenzied, mute appeal.
<P>
&quot;Come, my darling,&quot; Lord Pierrot bids her in a secretive
tone. &quot;Let us within. We shall baffle Lady Dove with our
boldness.&quot;
<P>
All at once he hears a dreadful sound.
<P>
&quot;<U>Pierre! Pi-erre!</U>&quot;
<P>
It is his wife. It is Lady Dove, materialising as if at the merest
mention of her name. She has left her bed and come blundering
into the garden in her nightgown. Lord Pierrot hears her now smashing
towards them through the undergrowth, bellowing for him like a
panic-stricken heifer.
<P>
Does she suspect? Has she seen them? Or is she sick, and roaming
in her sleep? Perhaps, of all things, her premonition has come
true: the full moon has unsettled her brain. It is a night for
the madness of women.
<P>
Lady Dove is coming nearer. Lord Pierrot sees her monstrous shape
bobbing in the darkness beneath the shade trees.
<P>
Silently giving thanks for the iron self-discipline, the blood
and breeding of the Pierrots that enable him to keep his head
even through the ordeal of such a night, Lord Pierrot puts his
fingers to the moist lips of Daphne Dolores, commanding her to
silence. He points across the croquet lawn to the flowerbeds.
They will confuse Lady Dove. She will not think to seek them that
way.
<P>
Daphne Dolores drops Lord Pierrot's hand. She sprints away across
the Triacian grass, Lord Pierrot panting after.
<P>
Trampling the blooms so carefully laid out by Lord Pierrot's horticultron,
they burst into the arbour leaving Lady Dove behind, still stumbling
through the shrubbery. Arriving at the door of the conservatory
they hear a faint, disconsolate moo, a distant sound of breaking
branches.
<P>
Inside, the house begins, without asking, to raise the lights.
Lord Pierrot countermands it. Daphne Dolores does not notice.
She hardly pauses to admire the glories of the Sirian frescoes.
She kisses Lord Pierrot vigorously and pulls him into the gloomy
passageway and along the hall, where the butler rolls out to greet
them.
<P>
It scans them with a brief burst of invisible light. &quot;<U>Good
evening, sir and madam,</U>&quot; it says, in its buzzing voice.
&quot;<U>May I take your coats?</U>&quot;
<P>
Daphne Dolores laughs uproariously, heedlessly. Her laughter echoes
in the rafters.
<P>
&quot;Let us go up, my love,&quot; Lord Pierrot bids her. &quot;To
my chamber.&quot;
<P>
Again she contradicts him, her blue eyes shining with joyous anticipation.
&quot;No, dear heart,&quot; she insists, &quot;to your laboratory!
Did you not tell me that Lady Dove never sets foot there?&quot;
<P>
With a private, wistful smile, Lord Pierrot congratulates her
on her stratagem. &quot;An excellent choice, my precious!&quot;
<P>
Ignoring the attentive automaton, they jump into the shaft and
float up to the level of the laboratories.
<P>
Here too Daphne Dolores strides ahead, as if she knows the way.
She was here once before; perhaps, unconsciously, in some infant
part of her brain, she remembers it. She sweeps through the catalogue
room, where all knowledge lies sleeping in banks of deep cold
drawers. In the mechanatory, beneath the great bleached skeletons
of Lord Pierrot's first automata, she runs her white hand carelessly
across the rack of obsolete implements, the tarnished rods and
serried claws that recall his years of service in the Innovation
Corps. She does not spare a glance for the cabinets of the salon
zoologique with their stiff, staring specimens of every kind of
fauna, natural and otherwise, as they reckon these things on the
planet Triax.
<P>
Lord Pierrot is pleased to follow her. Her haste gladdens his
old and disappointed heart. He is grateful that, in the dark,
she fails to notice the lines of mannequins above her head, encased
in glass along the wall. Each is clad in some cast-off of the
younger, slimmer Lady Dove; yes, even back to the yellow sundress
and matching gloves that she wore on their trip to the moon. It
would not do to let Daphne Dolores see those clothes; nor the
figures that wear them. They might disturb her.
<P>
&quot;Ah!&quot; cries Daphne Dolores then. She has reached the
last laboratory. She stands amid the vats, gazing about in wonder
and delight.
<P>
Behind her, Lord Pierrot slips into the curtained alcove for a
gown. As he plucks one from the hook and wraps it around his nakedness,
the homunculi stir in their nest of rags. Lord Pierrot hastily
silences their querulous cheeping, dropping a cloak over them.
He steps back into the laboratory.
<P>
The stained glass windows are black and opaque in the occluded
night. The only light in the cluttered chamber is a faint glow
of phosphorescence from the things in the vats. It highlights
the slick bubbles of alembics and retorts, the dusty brass barrel
of a giant microscope. There is a lingering scent of formaldehyde
and rotting orange peel.
<P>
Lord Pierrot sees Daphne Dolores padding barefoot from vat to
vat, trying to discern what each holds. Some are mere seeds yet,
little spatters of darkness in the broth. Others are burgeoning,
dendritic: a tubular stem with floppy branches above and below.
Daphne Dolores has reached one so far grown as to be spinning
a slick integument about itself, like a protective cocoon. Its
members are well defined.
<P>
The largest tank stands alone in the corner beneath a sagging
bank of shelves. The waters of that one, Lord Pierrot knows, are
empty.
<P>
As Daphne Dolores goes to peer into its slimy depths, the moon
of Triax suddenly heaves itself from behind a bulwark of cloud
and sheds light into the laboratory. All the coloured panes flare
up at once like a curtain of cold jewels.
<P>
Daphne Dolores turns about. She catches sight of Lord Pierrot
standing there in his white gown, and cries out in pleasure.
<P>
&quot;My love!&quot; calls Daphne Dolores. &quot;You have become
a very harlequin!&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot looks down at himself and chuckles. He is illuminated,
as if by the rainbow-coloured primary of an unknown world, daubed
from head to toe with carmine and gold and viridian. All down
his gown the smears of acids and enzymes show up as harshly as
though they were stains of rust or blood.
<P>
From beneath the coloured window comes a cry. &quot;<U>Pierre!</U>&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot crosses the floor and cautiously peeps out. Lady
Dove is there, still tangled in the bushes, swiping blindly at
the moonlight with her huge arms.
<P>
Daphne Dolores laughs.
<P>
&quot;Will you not take care of her?&quot; she asks.
<P>
&quot;Take care of her?&quot; repeats Lord Pierrot.
<P>
&quot;Release her from her misery.&quot;
<P>
She nods at his hand, at the fatal ring.
<P>
Lord Pierrot looks at his ring as if he has never seen it before.
He marvels at the audacity of Daphne Dolores, at the daring and
ambition she has concealed from him all this while. Her spirit
is a match for his own.
<P>
He sighs.
<P>
He opens the ring, inspects the reservoir. &quot;Let us be sure,&quot;
he says. &quot;I should not wish her to suffer even a moment.&quot;
He closes his eyes, suppressing a shudder of emotion, of potent
memory; and opens them again.
<P>
&quot;I have some fresh distilled. On that shelf up there, in
the corner.&quot;
<P>
Daphne Dolores turns to look at the shadowy ranks of vials and
flasks that have bowed the shelves. Lord Pierrot, feeling behind
the couch, fetches out a slender staff of glass a yard long, with
a brass ferrule. A homunculus scrabbles briefly from under the
valance. He shoos it back out of sight.
<P>
Daphne Dolores leans across the vat, stretching up to the bottles.
She cannot reach. She lifts herself up and puts one knee carefully
on the rim. The coloured light streaks her tiny buttocks.
<P>
&quot;Oh, I can&quot;t get it,&quot; she complains. &quot;Come
and help me.&quot;
<P>
Lord Pierrot comes and stands behind her. He puts one long, thin
arm around her naked waist, hugging her body to him as if to steady
her on her precarious perch. Her flesh is warm in his embrace.
With the other arm he reaches over her shoulder for the flask.
Their faces are very close together. Daphne Dolores turns her
head and kisses Lord Pierrot on the lips.
<P>
&quot;<U>Pi-erre!</U>&quot; moans the stricken woman beneath the
window.
<P>
Daphne Dolores gives a little laugh and slips her tongue between
her lover's teeth.
<P>
Lord Pierrot thrusts forward with his shoulder.
<P>
Daphne Dolores is small and slight, like all his women. With a
cry and a splash, she topples into the tank.
<P>
The questionable fluid at once froths pink, surging high and closing
avidly about her delectable limbs. It spatters Lord Pierrot's
motley gown, and he steps quickly backwards.
<P>
In the spume he catches a final glimpse of Daphne Dolores, bobbing
up: her startled eyes, her open mouth. He raises his glass staff,
plants its brass tip between her breasts, and thrusts her down.
<P>
From her little ears, her nose, her perfect lips, bubbles flurry.
Lord Pierrot waits patiently until they cease.
<P>
Whispering, the homunculi scuttle from their corners and come
to stand around him in a flock, holding hands and craning their
necks. They lift one another up to the glass.
<P>
Lord Pierrot does not rebuke them. The moment is too solemn. Wiping
the staff on his sleeve, he turns away and opens the window, admitting
a wave of hot, dank air.
<P>
Lord Pierrot sighs. The melancholy fit is upon him once again,
as always when he has made the great renunciation. One by one
he raises them; and one by one they become unstable, unreasonable,
and have to be stilled. Must it be ever thus?
<P>
He gazes out of the window into the thick and tangled garden.
By the light of the yellow moon of Triax he sees his wife, Lady
Dove, standing below, her nightdress in tatters, twigs and leaves
in her hair. She looks up and recognises him. A scowl crosses
her bloated face. &quot;<U>Pierre!</U>&quot; she shouts.
<P>
Fatigued, unhappy, Lord Pierrot orders the intelligence to send
his taxidermatron. Then he goes out through the salon, passing
beneath the line of his daughters, going to seek forgiveness once
again of Lady Dove.
