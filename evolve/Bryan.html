<H1>Bryan Talbot: Artist Guest Of
Honor</H1>

An immensely talented artist and writer, Bryan Talbot is
familiar to many people from his work on <B>Nemesis the Warlock</B> in 
<B>2000AD</B>.
He has also worked frequently with Neil Gaiman especially on <B>Sandman</B>.
Recently he was concept artist for <B>Return to Love</B>, a film directed by
John Sorenson, loosely based on Ramsey Cambpell's <B>Above the World</B>.
Negotiations are under way with the BBC. Bryan has spent the last two
and a half years completing <B>The Tale of One Bad Rat</B>, the story of Helen
Potter, an abuse victim who finds that her life oddly parallels that of
her favourite author, Beatrix Potter. Bad Rat is powerful, disturbing
and profoundly moving - and it's already causing controversy with the
Beatrix Potter Society backing it and the National Trust attacking it.
It's on sale now - take a look.<P>

Bryan is probably still best known
for <B>The Adventures of Luther Arkwright</B>, a tale of heroism and pacifism
set across parallel worlds in a universe threatened by the chaos weapon
Firefrost and the disruptors, mysterious stormtroopers in black. In one
parallel the Puritans still rule England and Hiram Kowolsky, foreign
correspondent for the New Amsterdam Herald, reports from his hideaway on
London Bridge... Arkwright fans will be glad to know that Bryan is
starting work on the sequel, which may well be finished in time for
Evolution.<P>
