<h1>Colin Greenland, Guest Of Honour</h1>

Colin Greenland is a familiar figure at British conventions, genial,
intelligent and witty. He's also a familiar figure on bookcases across
the world, thanks to the success of his novels <B> Take Back Plenty </B> and
<B> Harm's Way </B>.

<P>

Maureen Speller (another of Evolution's guests) takes a look at Colin's
<A HREF="Pierrot.html">fiction</A> in a piece from Evolution's PR1.
<A HREF="Barbarians.html">"Of Course We're Not Barbarians!"</A> is an
exploration of Colin's novels, but Colin is also well known for his short
fiction.<P>

We're pleased to be able to whet your appetites for Colin's work by
presenting, for the first time in electronic form, <A HREF="Pierrot.html">
A Passion For Lord Pierrot</A>. This excellent example of Colin's work was
first published in David S. Garnett's anthology of British Sf, <B> Zenith 2
</B>, and is republished with permission.<P>
