<title>Colin Greenland</title>
<H1>Of Course We're Not Barbarians!"</H1>

"Of course we're not barbarians. The barbarians live a long
way away, over the mountains." So remarks the young Jillian Curram to
her uncle in Colin Greenland's  The Hour of the Thin Ox (1987). But as
Greenland's novels so often show, the barbarians are always much closer
than you think.<P>

Take Daybreak on a Different Mountain (1984),
Greenland's first novel. In this, he paints a vivid picture of a society
in decay. Much like the Romans, the inhabitants of Thryn have built a
wall around themselves, to shut out the world, or perhaps to keep it in,
while they await their god, Gomath, who will return to perfect the city.
Dubilier and Lupio defy the laws of the city and flee into the
wilderness, living and travelling with the tribes, the so-called
barbarians. Yet who is the more barbaric: the citizens of Thryn who lift
not a finger to help themselves, or the tribes who have evolved a way to
survive without the dubious benefits of life in the city? Dubilier and
Lupio bring back a new, more complete vision of living and the groups
are reconciled.<P>

	In the world portrayed in The Hour of the Thin
Ox and Other Voices (1988) matters are far less clear-cut. A string of
small Balkan-type states view one another with suspicion and their
rulers find themselves caught up in an endless round of diplomacy, with
alliances constantly made and broken. Fortunes are won and lost
according to the signatures on the treaty and the world is in a state of
political flux. Everyone seems to have their own solution but none of
them will work together to achieve a lasting peace; Greenland embodies
this in the exploits of Jillian Curram, instigator of a suicide mission
to protect a group of people who are quite capable of taking care of
themselves, thank you very much, not because they mean anything to her
but because through this she can take her own revenge on the invaders
who destroyed her livelihood.<P>

	Other Voices shows the flip side
of this picture. While Bryland fights for its freedom, Luscany has been
conquered and Princess Netta lives ceremonially on show, a move
calculated by her Eschalan captors to reassure the populace. Again,
intrigue flourishes and all it takes is one brief moment of anger for
the peace to be shattered. Unlike Jillian Curram, however, Netta eschews
the volatility of the heart for a more considered approach in her fight
to regain her kingdom, although even she is drawn eventually into armed
resistance.<P>

	Greenland's first three books ostensibly
explored the eternal cycles which govern every society: peace and
violence, dissatisfaction and contentment, but it also became noticeable
that his female characters were gradually assuming control of his work.
Some, like Jill Curram, fulfiled that age-old male stereotype, of the
woman who acts first and then thinks, while others, like Netta, weigh
the consequences of every move. We should perhaps have been warned...<P>


But nothing prepared the world for Take Back Plenty which sprang
joyously onto the SF scene in 1990. The cover proclaimed it a space
extravaganza, and many readers felt this supported a trend towards
literate space opera initiated by Iain Banks' Culture novels. Others
enthusiastically praised Tabitha Jute, Plenty's protagonist, just your
average spacer trying to make a living, and as it happened, female, and
by virtue of that, a feminist statement. Too frequently, novels about
women in space are overtly that but Tabitha's gender was entirely
irrelevant in the context of the story, if of overwhelming importance to
readers who were tired of seeing women portrayed either as screaming
bimbos or as feminist stereotypes. In Greenland's future, women were
just getting on with their work.<P>

	And yet the familiar concerns
are also still there. Greenland's universe is inhabited by a range of
alien species, each competing to take control, echoing the inter-state
warfare of his earlier novels and indirectly posing the same questions
as Daybreak. Who has the right answer? Much of Plenty is concerned with
maintaining the status quo which, however dubious, is at least workable.
The emphasis though is on plot rather than philosophy, with the cultural
concerns moving into the background.<P>
 
	Instead we become
involved with Marco, leader of a highly unorthodox cabaret troupe, who
promises Tabitha the wherewithal to repair her beloved ship, the Alice
Liddell, if she'll only take him to Plenty. It's not that Marco is a
liar, you understand, just that "reality can be a little uncompromising
sometimes" and by embroiling Tabitha in a complex web of lies, Marco
plunges them all into a danger far greater than anyone can imagine.<P>


But if Tabitha Jute is struggling to keep control of her life, Sophie
Farthing, heroine of Harm's Way (1993) has entirely lost control of
hers. Harm's Way might best be described as a Victorian melodrama with
SF overtones. The formal language and recognition of the Dear Reader's
presence sends us back to a world perhaps more familiar to readers of
the Bront&euml;s.<P>
 
	Sophie is the classic orphan girl in jeopardy,
the rich heiress born out of wedlock, the disgraced child doomed to make
her own way in the world, the naive ray of sunshine who improves the
lives of those around her. She is, as she notes, "in harm's way" as
though Fate is working against her while she is a cork bobbing in the
Flux. All is, of course, resolved in the usual appropriately
melodramatic fashion but once again the familiar concerns lie under the
surface, all the poignantly  given the quasi-Victorian setting and the
low status of women, who are forbidden to be Pilots in a world dominated
by space travel and the constant to-ing and fro-ing of alien
visitors.<P>

	"My dream is a big one" says Dubilier in Daybreak. "It's
far ahead, calling me; and at the same time it's behind me, pushing me
forward! I can't be satisfied with small dreams." The dream Colin
Greenland offers is confusing but all dreams are confusing; it's in
their nature. It's a dream in which women participate equally in a genre
that has been traditionally the preserve of men, in which humans and
aliens will mix unremarked, but equally it's a dream in which baser
natures will break through from time to time, where the urge to colonise
and appropriate will surface time and again, as if to prove that reality
is indeed uncompromising.<P>
