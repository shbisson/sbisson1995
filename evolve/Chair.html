<title>A word from the chair</title> <H1>Yikes! A speaking Chair!</H1>

You're the Chair, you write the introduction, they said. "I
can't do that!" I cried. "Okay, write the afterword instead," they
replied. I've not got this committee properly trained yet.<P>

	Well,
here we are at the end of PR1. You will know by now that we have been
successful in finding a new site after our sadly abortive negotiations
with the Brighton Metropole. We are looking forward to holding an
Eastercon in the Radisson Edwardian and will be bringing literature
about it to future conventions so you can see for yourselves what it is
like. I am eagerly anticipating the signings and programme items in the
pool! The programme is shaping up with a mixture of the serious and the
silly; the hotel is ideal for the workshops we want to make a feature
of, and everyone seems to be happy - even the people who have resigned!
Yes, we're two down already... Rhodri James (whose fault this is) had
the good sense to ship out before the bid, and our publicity officer
Alex McLintock has left but has been replaced by Graham Taylor - doing
Pat's job of treasurer. Pat has been shunted into site liaison (taking
over from me - hooray) leaving me to take the mantle of publicity. I was
going to say that Steve Glover has not got a job, but he has just found
one in Edinburgh. Bert has been abducted by aliens, and Jeanette has
just discovered her long lost twin. Confused? You know it makes
sense.<P>

	While we were drunk at the 'Tun and not running away
screaming "No, no, we shall not run an Eastercon," we thought of using
the name Vivisection. This would let us use wonderful slogans like
"Vivisection - it's a cut above the rest," and advertise breakfast as
being smoked bacon, smoked kippers and smoked beagles - but somewhere
along the line we settled on Evolution. It seemed such an apt name, and
filled us with enthusiasm for doing new things with the Eastercon. The
trouble is that people use our name as a noun. Some recent fanzine
discussion on conventions has said (paraphrased wildly) "I remember the
good old days when cons were small and great. Now they're big and full
of sheep-like morons being herded around and they're too expensive.
Evolution - it's crap" - which of course it won't be!  Now we'd like
your money. If you are a full member, thank you for your money. If you
are not, please send us some!  This has been a public service
announcement. Thank you for listening.<P>
