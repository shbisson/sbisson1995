<A HREF="mailto:pat@cooky.demon.co.uk">Pat McMurray</A>: I'm 32 and I'm
Irish, almost six feet tall, married to Rona - and two cats, Sophie and
Silk. A graduate in Mathematics, I work in London as a
salesman-cum-engineer.<P>

	I like animals, especially cats, and own
a Mac named "Gimme Cookie!"  I've been reading SF all my life starting
with Heinlein, Fisk and Christopher - favourite authors today  include
Gene Wolfe, Iain (M) Banks, Mary Gentle, Frederik Pohl, Umberto Eco,
Paul Leyner, Nevil Shute and Henry Treece. I have several thousand books
and creaking shelves.<P>

	I like beer and vodka and will eat
almost anything. I can survive long periods of time without too much
sleep and I have a very silly sense of humour.
	My first convention ever
was Helicon, Easter 1993, but even then I was working (hidden away in
the Green Room). I'm also a regular drinker at the 'Tun in London, where
coherence on my part is not guaranteed.<P>
