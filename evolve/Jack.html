<H1>Jack Cohen: Scientist Guest of
Honour</H1>

Jack Cohen is a reproductive biologist who designs alien
worlds and lifeforms. His new book <B>The Collapse of Chaos</B> (written
with Ian Stewart: well known for the <B>Scientific American</B> "Mathematical
Recreations" column) gives
its readers a head start on the science of the future....<P>

He's also
the mind behind some of SF's most famous alien creatures: from the
Phagors of Helliconia, across the alternate world that lies west of Eden, home of
the intelligent dinosaur Yilane, to the implacable horror of the
Grendels in Niven, Pournelle and Barnes' <B>Legacy of Heorot</B>.<P>
