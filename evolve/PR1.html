Welcome to Evolution
and our first Electronic Progress Report! I'm glad to say we have plenty
of progress to report to you, most importantly on the site - <A
HREF="Hotel.html">click here for those all important details</A>.<P>


Our committee has often been described as a mixture of experience and
enthusiasm and we're certainly finding it a useful combination. We'd
like to
 introduce <A HREF="Who.html">ourselves</A> to you and to tell
you something about our Guests of Honour. We hope you'll find the work
of <A HREF="Jack.html">Jack Cohen</A>, <A HREF="Colin.html">Colin
Greenland</A>, <A HREF="Bryan.html">Bryan Talbot</A> and <A
HREF="Vernor.html">Vernor Vinge</A> as exciting as we do. We'd also like
to show you how our new hotel and guest are shaping that important part
of an Eastercon, the<A HREF="Programming.html"> programme</A>.<P>


Also in this EPR, you'll find some <A HREF="Recipes.html">Evolution
recipes</A>, to prove the attempted Conspicuous Consumption spoof bid at
Sou'Wester wrong - we have a deep and abiding interest in food! There's
also a word or two from Bridget Hardcastle, our esteemed <A
HREF="Chair.html">chair</A>.<P> 
 
	Like all conventions, we're
looking for volunteers to help out. We need people in the following
areas: almost everywhere (especially QuarkXPress-savvy DTP people). If
you would like to help with transport, Ops, security, publicity or any
of the many other tasks that an Eastercon brings in its wake, please
contact us at the <A HREF="mailto:bmh@ee.ic.ac.uk">Evolution
address</A>.<P>
 
	We'll need to work out what we have to do as
well as who we have to do it with, so please be patient if we don't get
back to you immediately - we will be in touch.<P>
 
	Similarly, if
you have any good ideas about what you'd like to see at Evolution, <A
HREF="mailto:bmh@ee.ic.ac.uk">we'd like to hear from you</A>.<P>
