<A HREF="mailto:bmh@ee.ic.ac.uk">Bridget Hardcastle</A> (also known as Bug) started going to conventions at Eastcon `90 and never got around to stopping as people keep persuading her to part with money for the next con. Running an Eastercon came as a surprise but is turning out to be A Good Thing.<P> 	She is also involved with ICSF (Imperial College SF Society) and goes to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show far too often. She is known for her fondness for chocolate, which she expounds upon at length in Obsessions, her fanzine, and likes Eastercons as they are a great excuse to get given chocolate.	In real life she is doing a PhD in silicon micromachines ("It's like science fiction every day", enthuses Bridget).<P>
