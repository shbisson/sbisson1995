<A HREF="mailto:mcharsley@cix.compulink.co.uk">Mark Charsley</A> is
Membership and (when he turns up) General Secretary. He's been known by
many names over the years, but most people know him as `that bloke in
the waistcoat'. He isn't really aardvark enough to refer to himself in
the third person, so I'll switch mid-sentence. My fannish credentiaIs 
are limited to running
the Oxford University SF Group and editing its newsletter and becoming 
Europe's best knurdler at
Helicon's Dead Dog Party. Despite all this,  I've been addicted to cons 
since I was bullied
into buying an Illumination membership by Dave Clements and have a
couple of ideas about improving them. I work (in the loosest possible
sense of the word) at GEC Hirst, and my interests include stand-up
comedy, comics, computers, films, hive minds, light-hearted RPGing and
recovering from glandular fever.<P>
