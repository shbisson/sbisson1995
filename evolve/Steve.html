Steve Glover discovered conventions in 1979. However he used the flyer as a bookmark, so it was 1985 before he first attended a con. Since then, he's been to lots of cons (64 at the last count) and had a go at most things in fandom: fanzines, conrunning, APAs, filking, a stint at co-editing Matrix, and up until last Easter could safely claim to have tried almost everything in congoing fandom except entering a masquerade and running an Eastercon. Steve is the most northerly  committee member, having just moved to Edinburgh. Outside fandom, he can be seen participating in those varied areas where having a beard, spectacles, good taste in beer and bad taste in t-shirts aren't seen as besetting sins.<P>
