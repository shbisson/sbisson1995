Born on the Channel Island of Jersey, <A HREF="mailto:simon@ukonline.co.uk">
Simon Bisson</A> used to live in Borehamwood where his local supermarket was 
once the Death Star. He's now gone West, and has moved to Bath...<P>

Simon used to play with fast computers, very fast lumps of metal and
electromagnetic launchers at Bath University - until the money ran out.
He then didn't wear T-shirts and bermuda shorts at the GEC Hirst Research
Centre's Network Systems Group whilst conducting architecture studies for
cordless multimedia systems (they're cordless, and they're multimedia...).
These day's he's the technical manager of the value added Internet service
provider UK Online.<P>

Not an urban person (unless it's somewhere with <B>lots</B> of bookshops), 
he walks, climbs and builds narrow gauge steam railways up Welsh mountains. 
A self-professed net.nomad, he's often found complaining about the weight 
of the Iron Chicken, his portable Internet site. Fannishly he reads far too 
much Sf, and was the accidental founder of the Bath Sf Discussion Group. 
These days, he just gets grabbed by masked strangers and forced to run 
conventions...<P>

He blames it all on watching the Apollo-11 moon landing on a flickering
black and white TV at goodness knows what time in the morning at a
rather impressionable age.<P>

As you can tell, he's also Evolution's webweaver. There's more to his pages 
than Evolution. <A HREF="../index.html">Take a look!</A><P>
