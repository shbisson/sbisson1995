<A HREF="mailto:graham@cyteen.demon.co.uk">Graham Taylor</A> is Evolution's treasurer, newly evolved from assistant treasurer. His conrunning origins start with Uniconze in 1990, when he was also treasurer. A brief experimentation with international football proved something of a dead end.<P>	By day, he works as an actuary for an insurance company. His responsibilities include ensuring that his company doesn't run out of money to pay its policyholders - which should make him a safe pair of hands.	SF interests include high tech and alternative reality, in particular England's remarkable and surprising successes in the 1994 World Cup.<P>
