<B>Welcome to Simon's Web, a little oasis hung somewhere off the World Wide 
Web.</B><p>

<font size=+1>
So who is <A HREF="evolve/Simon.html">Simon</A>, and what has he left here?<p>
Well, he's <A HREF="Images/simonfc.gif">Simon Bisson</A>, a freelance Internet
writer, who worked for the UK Internet Magazine <B>Online World</B>, where
he edited the "Neat Web Pages" section. Recently he's been writing for <A HREF
="http://www.futurenet.co.uk/computing/pcplus.html">PC Plus</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.futurenet.co.uk/misc/SFX/SFX.html">SFX</A>. Recently he was
rather amused to be interviewed for an 
<A HREF="http://www.futurenet.co.uk/computing/pcplus/Issue103/Netfull/
intro.html>article</A> on the size of the Internet. Does this mean he's
now a net luminary?<p>

He also helps run science fiction conventions, as well as writing for fanzines 
and apas. Simon enjoys
playing with funky graphics software - especially <I>Adobe Photoshop</I>
and <I>Kai's Powertools</I>, and has used them and other neat toys (including a
a Connectix Quickcam) to make the buttons and images scattered across these 
pages.<p>

Simon's now got a <A HREF="http://www.ukonline.co.uk/">new day job</A>,
but he'll let you find out about that one in due course. Just note the email
address...<p>

Simon's Web is where you'll find the interactive <A HREF="olw/index.html">
"Online World's Neat Web Pages",</A> the Electronic PR for the 1996 UK 
National Sf Convention, <A HREF="evolve/index.html">"Evolution: The Next 
Step"</A>, and a selection of<A HREF="stuff/index.html"> pieces written for 
UK fanzines and apas</A>. You'll also find a selection of links leading you 
further up and further in...<p>
