The information superhighway'sfibre-optic express routes cross the globe, spinning digits across the oceansat the speed of light. Sorry, but that's not enough: fibre will never reach themiddle of the Sahara Desert, or a ship out in the Pacific. And there's only oneway to get the bits out there: from space. The online world has set its sightson NASA's territory, and is racing out to claim its share of the highfrontier.<p>Motorola was first, then came Qualcomm, and now Bill Gates: all fighting for aslice of sky. all wanting to put a telephone in your pocket. So it's time tothrow away the big dumb boosters and the lumps of metal strung out in anecklace 22,000 miles above the equator: for the visionaries who built the Netsee things rather differently...<p>It's like the '70s all over again. Satellite communications is currentlydominated by a few big companies, with big satellites and bigger customers: IBMin the sixties, in the sky. Hughes Aerospace builds the birds, Intelsat andInmarsat operate them. If you're the BBC or British Telecom you might get touse them, from expensive fixed ground stations or just-about-portable satellitephones. But quietly, hidden in the background, new technology has been sneakingup on the orbiting mainframe, and if there's one thing the Silicon Valley geeksknow it's how to use new technology.<p>Space is getting cheaper. The American Clementine mission recently showed thatoff-the-shelf components could produce better results than an expensive custombuilt probe - the hardware survived its journey to the moon, and Clementine wasready for a trip to an asteroid when it hit a software bug, turned on all itsthrusters, and promptly ran out of fuel.<p>Meanwhile, on the ground, a company with a winged rocket and a second-handLockheed Tristar is undercutting NASA and Arianespace. Orbital Science'sPegasus booster is dropped from an aircraft, before firing its solid-rocket andleaping for orbit. They're not alone in working on cheap ways of putting lumpsof metal in orbit. McDonnell Douglas has been experimenting with the DC-X, aprototype single stage to orbit launcher. With it's many cheap rocket enginesand solid construction DC-X has more than proved the SSTO concept - for lessthan the cost of the Space Shuttle's toilet.<p>Cheap satellites and cheap launchers: the building blocks of a new industry.<p>The geeks who grew up with science fiction dreams of pocket phones andcomputers are now billionaires and CEOs. They want to build the future theydreamed, as they stumbled through a bookish high-school and college. The nerdsare here, and they've got the cash.<p>First off the launch pad were Motorola, flush with dollars after building theworld's cellular phone systems. At heart Motorola are a workstation company -powerful machines on the desktop, not cheap, but as good as the mainframethey've replaced. This philosophy is at the heart of their satellite system.Iridium project intends to provide cheap global communications (voice, fax,e-mail) from its 66 satellites - there were originally going to be 77: theatomic number of Iridium. The Iridium consortium has already raised almost abillion dollars, for its $3 billion project, with international partners inevery continent. The main catch: a terminal will cost nearly $3000. Of course,as time goes by, it'll get cheaper  - but then, who'll be the early adopters?It's like the DEC Alpha, really neat if you can afford one.<p>Globalstar is the brainchild of navigation systems manufacturer Loral andcommunications experts Qualcomm (makers of the Eudora email program). Cheap andfast, Globalstar's 48 satellites will use half the power of Motorola's, whilstproviding nearly 20 times the capacity. How can they do this? Motorola aresending data to and from Iridium in defined timeslots. Qualcomm are hoppingtheir lower power signals across the frequencies, allowing many more people toshare the same piece of radio spectrum. It'll also be a lot cheaper to use thanIridium - a Globalstar phone will only be about $750 (about the same price asan early cellular phone). Think of Globalstar as a Silicon Graphics Indy - asgood as the best of them, and a lot cheaper.<p>There's a new boy in satellite town, and the pioneers are staring to lookworried. It's Bill Gates, and he's not building mainframes or workstations.Bill's got Satellites for Windows: 840 of them to be precise. Microsoft arepart of the Teledesic group, together with one of the largest US cellularcompanies, McCaw. Teledesic wants to build 840 small satellites, making many tomake them cheap, throwing them into orbit 8 at a time. When the Teledesicsystem is complete there'll be the equivalent of 2 million T1 1.5 Megabit persecond digital lines in the sky, ready to be grabbed by 20 million potentialcustomers. And all for $9 billion dollars. They won't offer voice, just e-mailand data, but like a PC, it won't be difficult to plug in some software to turna Teledesic terminal into a phone.<p>The lights are still red, but the geeks are lined up at the start, waiting forthe green, and a dash for cash from space. Their accountants are smiling, allhoping for a lot more than pennies from the digital heavens. It's a race we'reall going to watch.</body></html>
