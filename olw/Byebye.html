Beside our roadsappear strange metal towers, on the roofs of tall buildings sprout complexantenna clusters. All the phone numbers in Britain are about to gain an extradigit. What is it that links these changes and the coming revolution incommunication?<p>Physicists and chemists talk about a phase change: the point at which the ruleswe've known suddenly vanish, and a substance behaves in completely new ways. At0 degrees water becomes a solid, at 100 it's a gas. Today we're watchingsomething very similar happen to the ways in which we communicate. There's aphase change happening. At MIT's famous Media Lab Nicholas Negroponte haswatched it coming, in influential business magazines and a series of books theeconomist George Gilder has charted its inevitable progress.<p><p>As you subscribe to cable TV or buy a mobile phone you are bringing about thischange.<p>And this phase change is really very simple: what used to be carried by twistedwires and cables will cross towns and cities by radio, and what once flew overthe radiowaves will speed across the fibres and cables of the infobahn.<p>The process has been called the Negroponte switch, and today in Britain we'reslap bang in the middle of it. The telephone system as we know it will soonvanish, turning into a complex web of cellular networks and high speed fibreoptic trunks. Terrestrial television broadcasts will start to fade away,overtaken by cable and digital satellite transmissions (sell those shares inGranada and Carlton and buy BSkyB now!).<p>So why is this change happening? Consider the telephone. It's a simple tool, amature technology little changed from Alexander Graham Bell's first prototype,designed to carry the low fidelity, low data rate human voice from point topoint, with just a pair of cables carrying voices to and from your home. If youwere to transmit these signals digitally all you would need is a data rate of64 thousand bits per second - with 32 thousand bits per second considered to bemore than adequate.<p>Now consider the television. Again another simple device, not much has changedin the last twenty years or so. It's a receiver, ready to show picturestransmitted from radio stations miles away. Pictures of high resolution, highquality, many thousands of colours, complete with a stereo sound-track. Thebest data rate you'd get from a highly compressed digital television system isaround 2 million bits a second - over 30 times as much as required for a singletelephone conversation. The analogue television signals we're familiar withrequire over 8 times as much bandwidth as an equivalent digital signal.<p>There's only room for 4 and a bit wireless television channels in the UK, andthere are a lot of problems with squeezing the new Channel 5 in - among whichis the need to retune every single video recorder in the country. There'senough room for over 500 channels on a bit of coaxial cable, as well as severalhundred telephone conversations and a high-speed Internet connection. Anywonder that the cable TV market is possibly the fastest growing part of theBritish economy? Any wonder that the American regional telephone companies havetaken advantage of Britain's deregulated cablecoms market to develop theirvision of the infobahn before unleashing it on the US of A?<p>The folk at BT aren't blind. They've seen the future coming and are strugglingto catch up with it. Experiments with video transmissions over the humbletelephone line are taking place, whilst BT struggles to escape theentanglements of regulation. But it may be too late for them, with the Americanphone companies' cable TV franchises taking customers away, seduced by theprospects of an interactive on-line future of 500 channels of digital TV andfree local phone calls.<p>So why the extra digit on the phone numbers? It's all part of the pattern. Fastforward a year or two on from Phoneday, and you'll have to dial every digit ofa number. The need for local codes will have disappeared, vanishing in thecomplex web of the intelligent network. You won't be able to tell if an 0181number is in London or York, and that's not the end of it. Not long afterwardsnumbers will become portable, following us from our digital phones in our homesplugged straight into the cable infobahn, to our cellular and satellitemobiles, to our desks at work, to friends' homes... everywhere we couldpossibly be.<p>Welcome to the Telecosm: the world predicted by George Gilder in his eponymousbook. A world where communications unlimited by bandwidth is redefiningsociety. It began with the Microcosm, the silicon chip and the computer. Nowit's moved on with the development of fibre optic communications networks andpowerful digital coding systems. We're now standing on a hill looking out overa new land: a place full of hidden machines, computers in the background, aworld of dark fibre pushing billions of bytes of data around the world, tohomes, to cars, to our pockets.<p>When General Cornwallis surrendered his troops to the American militias at theend of the War of Independence, the band played "The World Turned Upside Down".Today, as the old TV and telephone companies face an uncertain world whereeverything they understood to be true is becoming its opposite, the band isplaying again.</body></html>
