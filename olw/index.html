Online World is a print Internet magazine from the UK, and I edit the
"Neat Web Pages" section of its Internet Guide - I also look after the
Ftp sites section, but that doesn't work so well on the Web!<P> <P> This

took a look at the history of the Web, and a couple of ways to navigate
it.<P> <P> <A HREF="neat1.html"><IMG SRC="../Images/smallweb.gif">Click

the billionaires of Silicon Valley?<P>
