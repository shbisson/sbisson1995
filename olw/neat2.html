<p>
Michael Rodd, Raymond Baxter, Howard Stableford, Maggie Philbin, Carol
Voerderman: the list of Tomorrow's World presenters goes on and on. It's filled
our TV screen's, first on Thursday nights and now on Fridays for as long as we
can remember, and now it's on the Web. The Tomorrow's World pages are part of
the BBC's Web service (a net.radio-times?). On them you can find information
about past and previous programmes (though currently only for the series that
started at the beginning of October). There's also a brief history of the
program - all 1107 editions. Worth a quick visit.<p>

<p>
Remember the queues in the summer of '77? Remember thrilling to the exploits of
Luke Skywalker and Han Solo? Remember the battles over the Death Star, the Ice
Planet of Hoth and the Forest Moon of Endor? Did it all really start nearly 20
years ago? With Star Wars games like Tie Fighter and X-Wing filling our
machines hard discs and George Lucas rumored to be working on the first three
films of the saga the Web's Star Wars pages are the place to be. <p>

<p>
The music industry has found the Internet. The independent label Go! Discs has
just put up a set of pages on the Web, offering information on their artists as
well as sound samples from new singles and albums. Once the home of Billy Bragg
and The Housemartins, Go! now have a roster of artists that includes Paul
Weller, The Beautiful South, and Portishead. Take a look at the Beautiful South
section, and listen to a snippet of their latest single. Be careful, though,
it's over 800K long - around 5 minutes of download time, even with a fast
modem! One for the fans of this label's artists.<p>

<p>
The Magellan space probe plummeted to a fiery doom in the atmosphere of Venus
on October the 12th, ending its 5 year mission. This real star trek isn't over
yet, there's years of work to be done in analysing the gigabytes of data sent
back from Venus. The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Magellan Web pages are
full of information and images of Venus - including spectacular radar images of
the surface of our cloud shrouded sister planet. Is Venus' planetary greenhouse
to be our fate? Surf over to this URL and find out. One for the hotlist of the
aspiring net.space-cadet.<p>

<p>
You may have thought the net was safe, full of cool people who wear mirror
shades and surf the rad bleeding edge of technology. Unfortunately, you're
wrong. We're really all anoraks, clutching our virtual pads of paper and
collecting the numbers of the IP packets that pass in and out of our machines.
And just to prove it, take a hop across to the riveting European Railway
Server. Here you'll find the details of thousands of train classes from all
over Europe, full of those fascinating facts about operating voltages and train
sizes that you always wanted to learn. Carriage fans also have their place
here, with full colour images of trains and carriages from all over the world.
There's even a place for fantasy railways. Puff on through this URL.<p>
