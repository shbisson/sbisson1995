<B>A review for <I>Vector</I> by Simon Bisson</I>
<P>
We're all familiar with the machines that both make up and manufacture
our 20th century world. The engines of industry are large and
visible. Now take a step into tomorrow, where a box in the corner
of the room provides all your daily needs. Tomorrow's engines
of creation are going to be so small as to be invisible: the nanotechnological
dreams of the young American scientist K. Eric Drexler. Nanotechnology
is the science of molecular machines: molecules moulded into devices
that can manipulate individual atoms. If Drexler is to be believed,
nanotechnology promises a future of unlimited plenty and almost
eternal life. His is a possible future that could exceed the boundaries
of even the wildest science fictional speculations.
<P>
Ed Regis is a science writer fascinated by the fringes of science
and technology. His previous book, <B>Great Mambo Chicken And
The Transhuman Condition</B>, was a voyage through the wilder
Californian extremes of science - from cryogenically frozen heads
to the strange edges of advanced robotics. With <B>Nano!</B> Regis
is focusing in, pointing his journalistic microscope at the developing
science of molecular nanotechnology. Like his fellow science journalist
James Gleick, Regis uses the tool of biography to explore the
history of a science. In the acclaimed <B>Genius</B> Gleick used
Richard Feynman's life to illustrate the development of quantum
electro-dynamics, and so, with <B>Nano!</B> Regis explores the
short history of nanotechnology in tandem with the life of its
prophet and theorist, Kim Eric Drexler.
<P>
Drexler's life forms the centrepiece of Regis' book: from his
early days as part of Gerard O'Neill's space study group, to his
testimony before a US senate commission. In his exploration of
the young scientist's motivations (Drexler is not yet 40), Regis
returns again and again to the Club of Rome's pessimistic futurological
study <B>The Limits To Growth</B>. Here is the heart of Drexler's
dreams - a desire to save the world from stasis and decay. But
nanotechnology isn't an instant techno-fix, and Regis isn't afraid
to show the dangers of the technology, amongst them the possibility
of a world eating swarm of rogue nanomachines.
<P>
In the best of journalistic modes<B>, Nano!</B> is happy to look
at the ideas of Drexler's critics as well as his supporters. The
controversial nature of nanotechnology means that Drexler has
many vocal critics across many different fields. As Regis and
the critics point out, there are many physical obstacles to the
development of nanomachines. Regis uses the criticisms as a basis
for a plea for more research into the problems and their possible
solutions. Drexler's conflicts with heterodox science make interesting
reading, and their resolutions and explanations cast light onto
the mechanisms that drive the physical sciences. Of course any
modern day work of scientific journalism, especially one dealing
with the physical sciences, can't escape the obligatory reference
to Richard Feynman. In <B>Nano!</B>, however, Feynman's place
is deserved, as in a nine-days wonder 1950s speech, Feynman challenged
scientists to think about constructing atomic scale devices; a
speech that twenty years later encouraged Drexler to publish his
early nanotechnology speculations.
<P>
Regis' <B>Nano!</B> is an entertaining look at the development
of what could be a truly revolutionary science, one that has inspired
many recent works of Sf, by authors who span the alphabet: from
Poul Anderson to George Zebrowski. The book is a worthy overview
of a complex topic, giving a solid grounding in the scientific
background of nanotechnology, and the interested reader can then
take the next step into Drexler's own works: the polemical <B>The
Engines Of Creation</B> and his textbook of molecular nanotechnology,
<B>Nanosystems</B>.
