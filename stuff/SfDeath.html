No!<p>So why do people claim it is?<p>It's time to take a look at the bookshelves. No, not those at home, but thoseof your local bookshop. Bookshops vary enormously from place to place; they maybe large pleasant places, full of quiet music and people, they may be small,filling a corner on a back street, they may even be a W.H. Smith. But in mostcases they will stock Sf and fantasy, some having large areas dedicated to thegenres, some just a few shelves. All these shelves, wherever they are, are fullof books. However, it often seems that there is nothing on them worthreading...<p>So how can you, the discerning and literate reader, find the hidden treasures?They are probably on those very shelves, surrounded by copies of <b>DungeonBarbarian's Interminable Quest Volume VIII</b> and <b>Right-Wing MercenariesWith Big Guns Conquer the Universe...Again</b>. But finding these worthies isno easy job, as the figures that the Sf newspaper <b>Locus</b> provides in itsannual market survey show.  During 1992, over 1,800 genre works (Sf, Fantasyand Horror) were published in the USA (an 8% decrease compared to the previousyear!) and 822 in Britain, including reprints. That's over two a day. Even ifthe fastest reader managed to keep up with the publishers by reading the 424new books, they'd at least have trouble paying for them all, with prices of atleast a fiver per volume...<p>Theodore Sturgeon was said to have stated that 90% of everything is crap. Inthese high production nineties that means there's a large pile of wasted woodpulp. In that long ago time of the 50's and 60's the smaller amount of genrefiction let the gold shine through the mud, as a reader panned through theformulaic space operas for future classics. Word of mouth carried news of thepromise of new writers, enabling readers to find what they wanted moreeffectively. Though purists may attempt to deny the power of the grass roots,the current literary standing of Dick and Ballard was a result of peopleenjoying their work and telling their friends. The critical prominence of Dickhas only really come about through the academic work of dedicated fans, thoughtrue appreciation had to wait until after his death.<p>So where today can we find that vibrant pulse of exciting, relevant speculativefiction. is it hidden in the dying spark of the cyberpunks as they fade away inshare-cropped gameboy netspaces? Is it espoused in the gender politics andpolemics of feminist Sf? Where can we find that old sense of wonder, or that<b>New Worlds</b> spark of prose adventure? And how do <i>I</i> find it?<p>It is time to return to the roots of written Sf, taking another look at theshort stories in the magazines and original anthologies and collections. It wasin such pages that many revolutions in style have occurred, that the New Wavelit its first torches and Bruce Sterling's paper army of cyberpunks raised thebanners in their attempt to redefine Sf. For the past six years I've foundGardner Dozois <b>Best Sf</b> collections to be a springboard into the depthsof fiction. It was in these pages I found the ever-changing Walter JohnWilliams, the calculated high weirdness of Howard Waldrop and the lyrical proseof Karen Joy Fowler. Going back to 1992's number, I find a collection ofstories that in turn amused, moved and enthralled me. Consider two verydifferent stories from this volume...<p>Nancy Kress, <b>Beggars in Spain</b>: At first glance just another dystopianstory of genetic engineering, it rapidly becomes a forceful morality tale,contrasting and examining intolerance and acceptance, love and indifference,whilst exploring the relationships of a modified human with her 'normal'sister, her family and her peers.<p>Ian McDonald, <b>Fragments of Analysis of a Case of Hysteria</b>: Apostmodernist scrawl through a psychiatric history, that may or may not beprecognition of death camps awaiting the protagonist, an emotional journey intothe depths of the twentieth century's darkest nightmare.<p>So if the roots of written SF are the short story, then what of the fruit ofthe plant, the novel?<p>Fresh grown from the pages of <b>Interzone</b> and <b>Asimov's</b> we findAustralia's bright new hope, Greg Egan. As <b>Quarantine</b> starts to wanderout on that word of mouth trail there are copies being passed from hand-to-handin pubs, its' mixture of hard boiled detective tropes a la Spillane, alteredstates of consciousness and far-out quantum physics synthesising something newand brave. Following a similar path is Geoff Ryman's <b>The Child Garden</b>,battered copies taking their places on student bookshelves, telling of the roleof art in changing the changeless. Then there is Vernor Vinge's <b>A Fire Uponthe Deep</b>, with its catchphrase memes leaving their marks on our fledglingcyberspace, its radical hard Sf coating an examination of how we communicate inour shiny new information age, ultra-intelligent, transcendent powersinfluencing the actions of individuals and civilisations.<p>From where I sit, there is still subversion and exploration out there on theshelves, there is relevance, there is literature.<p>Everywhere I look, the signposts to the future, and the present, of written Sfare clear, printed on the pages of magazines, in the indices of anthologies.They are there in the reference books, in the discussions of Sf groups aroundthe country. Just keep an ear to the ground and you'll find your way throughthe maze of modern publishing and see that Sf is not dead. who knows, maybe thenext book you'll pick up is that classic you've always been looking for...</body></html>
