<b><u>"Welcome my friends, to the show that never ends"<p>
</u></b><p>
This is my first contribution, so I'd better introduce myself. I'm Simon
Bisson, you've probably met me at The Champion or at a convention, or spotted
me out there on the Net. During daylight hours I'm a research engineer building
the fabled information superhighway, by night I'm most often found surrounded
by a pile of beaten paperbacks. I also write for <A HREF="../olw/index.html">"Online World"</A>, an Internet
magazine (I think it's quite good, but then again they let me write them fun
rants about telecoms...).<p>
<p>
The title? When I edited the Bath Sf Group's fanzine <B>"Aquae Sulis -- No
Parking"</B>, I felt like producing my own fanzine, but all that happened was the
title. It felt like such a good one, so...<p>
<p>

I was about 10 when I first read the short story. At the age of 13 someone
showed me the outline in Omni. I was in my twenties when the novel came out,
and I'm still waiting for the movie. But the other day, as I wait for my
thirties, I walked into my local record store, and found the CD.<p>
<p>
It may seem odd to write about music in an APA devoted to written Sf, but over
the years, no matter what else I've read, Arthur C. Clarke's story <b>"The
Songs Of Distant Earth"</b>, in all its incarnations, has remained one of my
favourites. So how does Mike Oldfield's album compare?<p>
<p>
"Songs..." is Clarke at his haunting best, his distant style a counterpoint to
the tragedy of a lost home, torn away by the impossible distances between the
stars, and the untimely death of the Sun. And yet, in the music that the
passengers of the last starship from Earth bring to the lotus-eating colonists
there's the hope of a new future.<p>
<p>
Oldfield tries to capture the spirit of the book in his music, an ambient
soundscape full of snapshots of speech and music. As he traverses the structure
of Clarke's novel, the songs sneak through, to culminate in the beginnings of
music: a tribal chant.<p>
<p>
It works. There's only one problem, there's the CD-ROM due next year.<p><p>

<p>
There's one hazard of being a bibliophile. It's not the problems with storage
(though when one leads a peripatetic life, that's certainly a problem!), it's
the to-be-read pile.<p>
<p>
Sometimes it's big, sometimes it's small. Mine never seems to drop below 20
books or so, leaping up and down in the corner of the room. In fact there are
two piles -- those in the database, those waiting for a chance for title,
author, isbn, date, and comments to be stored in binary. And the size of the
database continues to grow. It's not fun, remembering to type each book into
the machine as it's bought, so they gather, the uncatalogued, in their own
little piles -- uncatalogued, unread, uncatalogued, read.<p>
<p>
Oh, for a nice room with lots of shelves...<P>

Time for a quick trek through last month's reading.<p>
<b><p>
Agyar, Stephen Brust:</b> I don't normally read a lot of fantasy, but in that
genre Stephen Brust is a writer I keep coming back to. Agyar was a surprise --
a horror novel neatly disguised as urban fantasy. The novel follows a few first
person weeks in the life of Janos Agyar, who is not at all what what he
seems... Enjoyable, complex and well written.<p>
<b><p>
Starfarers, Transition, Metaphase, Nautilus, Vonda MacIntyre:</b> This one is
space opera for the '90s. A multifaceted story of Earth's first starship. This
space-going university heads off unprepared into the wild yonder, to make first
contact. McIntyre's four volume novel -- the only way to describe this work --
charts the tangled lives of the starship's faculty through the first failed
contact, and their attempts to both repair interstellar relations and to return
home.<p>
<b><p>
Midshipman's Hope, David Feintuch:</b> Hornblower in space -- no more, no less.
Feintuch has no pretensions, and has turned out a nice little pot-boiler. A
disaster kills off a starship's officers, leaving an inexperienced boy in
command (a familiar plot...), and he must struggle through various
central-casting adversities to his destiny. The art of the pulp lives on!<p>
<b><p>
The Well-Favored Man, Elizabeth Willey</b>: Another non-run-of-the-mill
fantasy, this is Zelazny's Amber with everyone being nice to each other. It's
also a sequel to "The Tempest" and a Heinleinesque science fiction novel:
Willey is one brave writer. And, against all the odds, this one works. It's not
"Little, Big",but it's certainly one of the best fantasy novels I've read.<p>
<b><p>
Dark Mirror, Diane Duane:</b> A Star Trek TNG novel, Duane's "Dark Mirror" is
rather fun (a dose of "guilty pleasure" reading). An alternate universe tale,
with a touch of the evil twins syndrome. Diane writes literate Sf and fantasy,
and manages to imbue her Star Trek offerings with a sense of fun -- as well as
a good story. Here she also manages to reveal that Picard gets his books from
Hay-on-Wye...<p>
<b><p>
Men At Arms, Terry Pratchett:</b> Pratchett never fails to amuse, and this
police procedural/comedy-of-manners/arms race satire hits the spot! Every now
and then I think that Pratchett must be some type of soap opera, as I find
myself looking forward to the reappearance of each minor character and place.
Ook ook. Woof.<p>
<b><p>
Manhattan Transfer, John E. Stith:</b> Hard Sf as disaster novel. Alien Okies
steal Manhattan Island, and add it to their collection of cities. This is
classic Campbellian puzzle fiction, man as superman solving the problems that
super-intelligent high-technology aliens find insoluble. It's nice to see that
American-ingenuity always wins through.<P><P>
