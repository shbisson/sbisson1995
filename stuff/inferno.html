Everyone has heard of the Asimov's Three Laws of
Robotics. We've seen how he used them to create stories based around
paradoxical interpretations of these laws, including a trilogy of
intriguing science-fiction who-dunnits. Now Isaac has passed his torch
onto Roger MacBride Allen, through the graces of the Byron Preiss
sharecropping factory.<P>

<B>Inferno</B> is part of a planned trilogy,
the sequel to Caliban, which introduced the eponymous 'No-Law' robot, as
well as a series of robots that obey a variant of the classic Three
Laws, the four New Laws. These give robots more freedom of action, as
they depend on co-operative activities rather than the Three Laws'
imperatives. In the same manner as Asimov's R. Daneel Olivaw/Elijah
Baley novels, <B>Inferno</B> is a who, or perhaps what, dunnit.<P>

The
<I>Inferno</I> of the title is a world simmering on the edge of conflict
between Settlers, new colonists from Earth, and Spacers, the
robot-dependent descendants of the original terraformers. With the
planet's terraforming beginning to fail, the scene is set for political
crisis and civil war. <B>Inferno</B> explores the cusp: the murder of
the planet's Spacer governor. In the ensuing turmoil the finger of
suspicion points at Caliban, and Sheriff Alvar Kresh, together with
Caliban's designer, must untangle the webs of conspiracy, whilst keeping
the fragile peace.<P>

There are a lot of share-cropped novels about,
and the Estate of the late Dr Asimov has a lot to answer for -- with the
<B>Robot City</B> and <B>Robots in Time</B> series filling the bookshop
shelves. Most writers seem to use these simple pot-boilers as a tool for
paying the bills, but Allen has interesting ideas and strong views, and
uses them to raise <B>Inferno</B> above the general sea of mediocrity.
His earlier novel <B>Orphan of Creation</B> explored the linked
moralities of animal experimentation and human slavery, in a tale of
living fossils. <B>Inferno</B> asks a new question: what
responsibilities do we have to slaves we've created? The co-operative
nature of the New Laws may be an answer, but remain chains of a
different sort.<P>

<B>Inferno</B> isn't classic Sf, but it is decent
midlist writing, suitable for that long train journey or a Spanish
beach. After his <B>The Hunted Earth</B> diptych, Roger MacBride Allen
has become a name to watch in the Hard Sf field, and <B>Inferno</B>
won't have done his career any harm.<P>
