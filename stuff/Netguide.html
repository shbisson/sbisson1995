We'd like to show you what some of these benefits are: for those whodon't connect to the Net, and, especially, for those who are consideringplugging their desktop PCs and Macs in to the fabled information superhighway.<p>Once you stop drowning in the waves of raw information and jargon, and startswimming, the Internet is an amazing source of information. The mostimmediately obvious routes to Net-enlightenment are the USENET news groups: thebiggest APA in the world.  Among these many, widely varied, discussion groupsthe dilligent fan will find such gems as <A HREF="news:rec.arts.sf.written">rec.arts.sf.written</A>, <A HREF="news:alt.fandom.cons">alt.fandom.cons</A>,<A HREF="news:alt.fan.pratchett">alt.fan.pratchett</A> and, yes, even <A HREF="news:alt.fan.pern">alt.fan.pern</A>. The discussions in these areasranges from the uninformed to the erudite, but are always entertaining, andoften full of snippets of detailed information.<p>We're often to be found taking part in the hubub of rec.arts.sf.written, one ofthe Net's busiest newsgroups.  Here you can learn interesting things aboutauthors and their novels. For example, a recent discussion explored the storybehind the name of the  Qeng Ho fleet in Vernor Vinge's <B>A Fire Upon the Deep</B>, which is based on a genuine historical Chinese trading fleet. In the contextof the novel this raises a whole boatload of interesting speculations andquestions, which were discussed, and argued over, at some length. <p>Apart from the basic discussions there are also some serious ongoingbibliographic projects.  One of the most interesting one is Robert B Schmunk'salternate history listing. This is intended to become a comprehensive listingof all alternate history short stories, novels and essays. This is a very largeundertaking, and would be an enormous task for one man, but suggestions forinclusions come from all over the net,  are peer-reviewed and then added to thelist. If you are interested in alternate history as a theme, you would reallylike to see this list. As the Internet is multinational, this listing is nowbecoming a multilingual task. The aim is to list all works ever created in thiscategory, in any language.<p>As well as information about books and authors, you'll be able to find listingsof conventions all over the world, complete editions of Ansible, book reviews andlistings of what'snew this week in American bookshops. By using other tools for file transfer andby looking in the right places, there are archives of the complete run ofAnsible (volunteers still wanted for typing in some of the early issues), thevenerable SF-lovers digest mailing list, lists of fannish e-mail addresses, andlime jello recipes. There are also on-line fanzines and newszines, oftenavailable by subscription.<p>Some conventions use the Net to advertise themselves, and to inform attendees.Currently Conadian has a strong presence, with detailed plans of what's goingto happen come the Worldcon. Soon Intersection, Confabulation and <A HREF="../evolve/">Evolution</A>will be offering similar services. Evolution and Intersection will be using theWorld Wide Web, a global hypertext system, whilst Confabulation are setting upan electronic mailing list. <p>The Net is also a very good place to keep in touch with friends and worktogether on projects. This cooperative effort between Simon Bisson and PatMcMurray was written using e-mail. Pat wrote the first draft and notes and thene-mailed it to Simon.<p>He read it, changed a few bits, added some text, cleaned it up and then sent itback to Pat. We then bounced it back and forth a little, before finallye-mailing it to Caroline Mullan. We have heared reports that the Internet isbecoming commonly used for such cooperative writing. <p>Similar techniques can be used if you happen to find yourself running aconvention, by running an e-mail discussion list everyone involveved can bekept informed, and talking, between committee meetings. In emergencies this iscan be a very good way of informing people and for finding a cooperativesolution.<p>Of course, there is not a lot you can do via this medium that couldn't be doneusing post or phones. It's obviously quicker than the post, but it also has abig advantage over phones, in that you can deal with it in your own time.You'll appreciate that if you work odd hours, if you tend to be busy most ofthe time, if people always ring you during dinner (hands up anyone who's lettheir dinned get cold while they responded to an interesting phone call). <p>The Net, in whatever form you join, CompuServe, CIX, Demon... can provide avery powerful communications tool, though its results can sometimes at firstseem bewildering and difficult to understand.  After a while, though, as youlearn to use the many tools that allow you to navigate the Net, the mistsclear, and the messages come through loud and clear.<p>Come on in and join the netsurfers, it's a real storm: but we'll help you notto drown while you learn to swim, just like others helped us.<p>Simon Bisson: <A HREF="mailto:simon@fehen.demon.co.uk">simon@fehen.demon.co.uk</A><p>Pat McMurray: <A HREF="mailto:pat@cooky.demon.co.uk">pat@cooky.demon.co.uk</A></body></html>
