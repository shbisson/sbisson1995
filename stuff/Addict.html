<H1>Confessions of a Net Junkie</H1>

The
scene: a rented room in a parish hall.<p>

The cast: assorted folk, of
all ages, sexes, professions. Somewhere a laptop PC
bleeps quietly. The
person sat in the nearest seat glares at the machine's
user, and they
shut the machine down guiltily.<p>

It's a meeting of the Net-surfers
Anonymous. A young man in a Suicide Squid
T-shirt stands up.<p>

"Hello.
My name is Simon Bisson, and, and... I'm an Internet user."<p>

Brief
applause.<p>

"I've been a net user for 8 years now. It started out with
a little casual
student hacking, a bit of DOS, a bit of UNIX, exploring
e-mail. Then I found
it. Usenet. Back when the net was flat... Those two
little letters 'rn' that
opened out into a whole wide world. There must
have been, oh, a hundred
newsgroups. I was happy to read for a while,
but soon the urge came upon me: I
had to post..."<p>

The speaker looks
down at his hands.<p>

"So I wrote my first article. Something about the
roots of cyberpunk for the
old <A
HREF="news:rec.arts.sf.written">rec.sf-lovers</A>. But I couldn't
post... I didn't have permission... So I
asked for a one off privilege,
and got it. But it wasn't a one off, I could do
it again, and again, and
again... All those little words vanishing off into
cyberspace, my
deepest thoughts, my most casual follow-ups... But it wasn't to
last, I
couldn't be a student forever, I had to get a job, I had to
lose
net-access.<p>

"But the gods smiled on me. Within two years I was
back at University, and this
time, this time they were paying me. I
found myself an account on the
University computer as soon as possible.
This time things were different. The
net wasn't flat any more, strange
hierarchies, alt groups, flame wars... I
threw myself in with a
vengeance. Thirty newsgroups and more a day, dipping in
to everything
that sat in my .newsrc.<p>

"It was that summer that I found <A
HREF="news:alt.callahans">alt.callahans</A>. "Callahans Bar for puns
and
fellowship" say the net-guides today. Back then it was still
starting to make
its mark, only six-months old, a small quiet gathering
of friends. I picked a
persona, a cartoon mouse, and began to take part.
I soon felt at home. I helped
organise RealSpaces, when I put faces to
the ASCII. The net was becoming an
important part of my life. I started
wearing the uniform of a net user, the
identifying traits of the news
groups I read: strange T-shirts, mountain
boots...<p>

"Soon after that
Janet joined the Internet completely. Now I could mainline:
using  IRC,
telnet and ftp. Before the term was invented I was a
net-surfer,
following the trails of Usenet postings to sites all over
the world, hunting
text, programs, images. It was exhilarating, the
world at my fingertips. I
sported a customised PC, running the latest
shareware, keeping ahead of the
technology...<p>

"I met her in
alt.callahans. Me, in a net.romance. That could never happen. But
it
did. Not as complex as some, for Mary lived in the same town as
me..."<p>

He smiles.<p>

"But again I had to lose the net. The grant
money that paid my salary ran out, and I had to find my way
to another
job. Horror of horrors. No net-access, just e-mail. What would I do?
The
withdrawl symptoms were hard, the fingers trembled, my eyes ached, I
needed
a fix, I needed a net-connection. At work I kept reading how the
net would
revolutionise the world. I knew <I>that</I> already. I wanted
it now...<p>

"Mary kept me up to date with alt.callahans, little
packets of laser print
dropping through the letter-box every week.
Meanwhile I began to save for my
own Internet connection, no longer
trusting in the whims of employers. It took
me 6 months. With the help
of a friend on holiday in America I purchased an
Apple PowerBook from
Shreveport, Louisiana. Buying by 'phone from the States is
easier than I
thought. Just fax a photocopy of a credit card over the satellite
links,
and a machine is yours... All you need to do is name it. Remembering
an
important childhood influence, I called it <I>The Iron
Chicken</I>.<p>

"With a quick net-surf from work I was able to buy more
memory and storage for
<I>The Iron Chicken</I>. E-mail to the States,
and a copy of <B>The Mac Internet Starter
Kit</B>, a book and the
software needed to connect a Mac to the Internet. The home
net
connection was almost there. Now I needed a modem. The yearly AppleExpo
was
the stalking ground for a modem hunt, with its myriad trade stands
and
boxshifters. I came back from Olympia with blistered feet, and a
Zoom modem in
my carrier bag. Another phone call was needed, this time
to Finchley, where
Demon Internet Services offer a net connection for
their famous 'tenner a
month'.<p>

"So there I was, <A
HREF="mailto:simon@fehen.demon.co.uk
">simon@fehen.demon.co.uk</A>, a
Mac, a modem, an Internet site.
News, ftp, telnet, IRC, gopher: all
pumped down the phone lines to my machine.
I was a net.nomad with an
Internet site in my back pack, just waiting for a
'phone line to be
free. But I needed more: more power, more access,
more
information.<p>

"A friend whispered to me the magic word 'Mosaic'.
A megabyte of interaction, a
page of text and pictures that was a window
into cyberspace. With just a click
of a mouse button on a highlighted
word and I could be anywhere. Text, sound,
stills, video, files,
programs: all linked on the World Wide Web. Hypertext the
way Ted Nelson
imagined when he wrote <B>Dream Machines</B> back in the
'70s:
information on tap, an intelligence amplifier pulling us up, up
into the
Singularity...<p>

"It's all there, all at your fingertips. And
it's free! The interface of choice
to the Internet, and no money changes
hands. The National Centre For
Supercomputer Applications in the US
provides Mosaic for Macs, for X-systems,
and, even, for Windows PCs.
Copies available for anonymous FTP at
src.doc.ic.ac.uk..."<p>

There's a
rustle of coats, a scraping of chairs. The hall is emptying.<p>

"What
did I say?"<p>

The last man out, turns at the door.<p>

"Meeting
closed. We're off to log on and net-surf for Mosaic...."<p>

"Hey, wait
for me."<p>

He picks up the bag at his feet, hefts it to his shoulder,
and runs off to
catch up with the man.<p>

"I know this really neat <A
