<html><head><!-- This document was created from RTF source by rtftohtml version2.5 --><title>Red Mars</title></head><body><H1>Literary War on the Incarnadine World</H1>Yes, there are a lot of books about Mars littered around under these pink skiestoday: Ben Bova's eponymous effort, Jack Williamson's <b>Beachhead</b>, PaulMcCauley's <b>Red Dust</b>, with Arthur C. Clarke's <b>Snows of Olympus</b> andGreg Bear's <b>Moving Mars</b> to come later this year. But the first of thecurrent batch on the bookshop shelves was Kim Stanley Robinson's <b>RedMars</b>.<p>John Clute liked the book and so did Arthur C. Clarke. Clute said it '<i>maysimply be the best novel that has ever been written about Mars.</i>'. A largeclaim for a large book. But at 501 pages is the novel worth the effort or is itjust another attempt to manufacture a bestseller?<p>Kim Stanley Robinson's fascinations with Mars and History are delineated inearlier works, from the explorations of memory in <b>Icehenge</b> to the climbof Olympus Mons that forms the heart of his novella <b>Green Mars</b> andthrough the stories that form the collections <b>The Planet on the Table</b>and <b>Remaking History</b> (aka <b>Down and Out in the Year 2000</b>). Duringinterviews Robinson returns time and again to his love of wild places likeDeath Valley and the Grand Canyon, those places that are Mars on Earth.<p>So many of the critics liked the book and KSR had been working on it for years,discussing his ideas with the scientists of The Mars Underground- a dedicatedcabal secretly plotting humanity's future on the crimson planet- and thenfinally formulating what is to be a trilogy. The first volume outlines theinitial terraforming and colonisation of Mars, from the founding of the firstpermanant settlement. <b>Green Mars</b>, which may encompass the earliernovella of the same name, though not contain it, will follow, the trilogypeaking with <b>Blue Mars</b>.<p>I have to admit to being a fan of the authors' works, having bought <b>The WildShore</b> when it was first published and waiting impatiently for the rest ofthe Orange County Trilogy. As a climber and felllow lover of wild places I alsodevoured <b>Escape From Katmandhu</b> and the epic moves of <b>GreenMars</b>.<p>So how do I see <b>Red Mars</b>?<p><H2>A Roseate Spectacle</H2>Red Mars</b> is a Political Novel. <b>Red Mars</b> is ecological Sf writ large.<b>Red Mars</b> is our world today.<p>The book is political in the sense that Robinson is writing about themotivations of a society, ecological as it is a tale of a planet beingtransformed, contemporary in that it is metaphor for our greenhouse home, fullof little conflicts that obscure the real issues.<p>The driving engine of the novel is the conflict between two philosophies- the'Reds' are conservationists who wish to keep Mars pristine while the 'Greens'just want to make the planet into a new Earth. Yet beneath this basic clash ofvalues, Robinson is writing an Utopian novel that shows the growing pains of anew society. Not unfamiliar with this Nowhere Mode, Robinson succeeded with<b>The Pacific Edge</b>, a novel that avoided the pitfalls of the tract-likenature of many of its subgenre predecessors. Whether the Martian Trilogy willalso steer clear of the typical Utopian fiction failings we will have to waitand see, but on the balance of the first volume Robinson may well be fallinginto the manifesto snare, with polemical  characters in the shape of Greenprotagonist John Boone and rival Red Anne Clayborne.<p><b>Red Mars</b> does have flaws, its didactic nature and sprawling storyoccassionally conspiring to disguise Robinson's love of place, camouflaging thepower of his descriptive prose. After a slow start as the colonists drift toMars, the novel comes to life as we follow Boone around his adopted world, butwe see the pace flag as Robinson attempts to detail the societies in conflict,only to come to life in a final orgy of deconstruction. But despite theseweaknesses, there is a powerful story here, with the remainder of the trilogyworth waiting for - <b>Green Mars</b> will come along and take up the batonlater this year. When picking up <b>Red Mars</b>, we are taking in our handsfive years of a writers' life, years of dreams and fascinations that haveresulted in this book. I for one am sure those years are worth it. It will bealmost as interesting to see how the rest of the current crop of Martian novelscompare when all are available and we have time to harvest them.</body></html>
