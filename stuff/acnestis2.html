<H1>&quot;Lost in the Library of Life&quot;</H1>

<H2>The New Number 2</H2>

<H3>An Acnestis Submission from Simon Bisson </H3>

<P>
<B>February, Borehamwood </B>
<P>
It's been an odd couple of months. Mixed good and bad: a decent
enough second-hand bookshop has opened in town - allowing me to
track down a few holes in my collection, but the publisher of
the Net magazine I've been writing for has decided to run off
with all the profits, without paying any of his freelancers -
including the editor.
<P>
Ho hum. At least I've had time to read a lot of books, and build
my World Wide Web pages. That, and marvel at the new IBM adverts.
Not so much adverts for IBM, more for technology: Les vieux by
the Seine, who want bigger disks, the Net-surfing nuns...
<P>
<B>There's a Hard Rain... </B>
<P>
Sometimes I wonder if Bruce Sterling has a wire in the back of
my head. Each time I pick up on of his novels or collections,
it feels like I'm in Charlie Stross' Watford flat, having one
of those conversations that ends up as a novel outline. <B>Heavy
Weather</B> was like that, only more so. And on a wet February
night, after the warmest and wettest January recorded, I wonder
if 2031 is really that far away... The heavy weather seems to
be here already...
<P>
They say that near future hard Sf is the hardest to write, and
I can see why. My day job is as a research engineer in a laboratory
developing the telcommunications systems of tomorrow, and in the
evenings I freelance as a computer journalist specialising in
the Internet. <B>Heavy Weather</B>, for all its tornado hunting
trappings, is a novel about the effects of advanced communication
technologies on the world, and how to survive them. These are
the tools I build and use every day of the week, and it's a future
I can see coming. All the technologies that Sterling writes about
are on the drawing board or in the lab. Is it 2031, or is it the
day after tomorrow?
<P>
Sterling's seen the future, and it's broken. Digital money, virtually
free communications, virtual phones: all foretelling the end of
organised society, freeing the people from the state, but shattering
the social contract. All that's left is what you can hack - your
skills, your hobbies. The Storm Troupers hack tornadoes, and they
know that the big one is coming. Threading their way through greenhouse
America, home of structure hits (disorganised urban terrorism),
refugee crises and advanced technologies, they wait for the ultimate
tornado, knowing that it will either kill them or change them.
<P>
Sterling is good at travelogue: <B>Schismatrix</B>, <B>Islands
In The Net</B>, <B>The Artificial Kid </B>- nearly every novel
he's written. <B>Heavy Weather</B> is no different, more focused
on Sterling's native Texas, perhaps, but travelogue nonetheless.
As the Troupers chase twisters, we follow them across the American
midwest, seeing the results of civilisation's on-going phase digital
change. Dystopia, perhaps, after <B>Islands In The Net</B>'s Utopia.
But, whilst <B>Islands</B>' Utopia had flaws, <B>Weather</B>'s
Dystopia has hope. Sterling is, at heart, an optimist. Perhaps,
if brokengenes can be repaired, if cities can be reborn, the perhaps
we can fix the future...
<P>
There are only a few books that have given me a taste of what
tomorrow may <I>really</I> be like. John Brunner's thematic quartet
was first, with the <B>Shockwave Rider</B> the best of the bunch.
Then there was Brin's <B>Earth</B>, if you can overlook the pocket
black hole machine and the <I>deus in machinam</I> ending. Vinge's
<B>True Names</B> comes close, and Gibson and Stephenson are allegorical
guides. Sterling's short stories and novels, as well as his non-fiction,
have been recent additions to the list.
<P>
If the Singularity doesn't sneak up on us, and change everything,
then <B>Heavy Weather</B> is one of Sterling's roadmaps to tomorrow...
<P>
<B>Recent Reads </B>
<P>
<B>Green Mars</B>, <I>Kim Stanley Robinson:</I> The Mars trilogy
progresses, along with the terraforming. Robinson is using Mars
as a focus of his Utopian yearnings, and the struggles of the
Greens and the Reds, as they try to shape the world and themselves,
map onto the Earth of the 1990s, and the threat of our ongoing
terraforming efforts. The forthcoming <B>Blue Mars</B> is awaited...
<P>
<B>Green Mars</B>, <I>Kim Stanley Robinson</I>: Not the Mars trilogy,
precursor perhaps, aim possibly. This is Mars post terraforming,
a world newly alive, where the cliffs of Olympus Mons challenge
a dispartate group of climbers, and shake an ex-politician into
a new appreciation of his home. Highly recommended (and if you
find the Tor Doubles edition, it comes backed with Arthur C. Clarke's
wonderful <B>A Meeting With Medusa</B>).
<P>
<B>Grailblazers</B>,<I> Tom Holt</I>: Pratchett doesn't do much
for me, but Holt is much more to my taste. Pratchett puts modern
characters into mythical situations, whilst Holt puts the mythical
into the modern. <B>Grailblazers</B> is Arthurian myth in head-long
collision with Major's Britain, and all the while in the background
lurks the dark, brooding, evil figure of Father Christmas.
<P>
<B>Faust Among Equals</B>, <I>Tom Holt</I>: Okay, I confess, I've
been on a Tom Holt trip, warped myth is something that appeals
to my warped sense of humor. Marlowe's <B>Faust</B> is a classic
tale, whilst <B>Faust Among Equals</B> is, err, rather different.
'Lucky George' Faust has escaped at last from theme park Hell
(now renamed EuroBosch), and on he's on the run. Is the Milk Marketing
Board behind it all? Will Helen Of Troy bankrupt another kidnapper?
And how do you evict an entire continent?
<P>
<B>Mysterium</B>, <I>Robert Charles Wilson</I>: Robert Charles
Wilson is one of those writers I buy on sight. He has an unusual
talent, a means of combining two sub-genres and giving them a
spin into something new and strange. <B>Mysterium</B> is the strange
child that results from Wilson directing the mating between gnosticism
and parallel worlds. Recommended.
<P>
<B>Burning Bright</B>, <I>Melissa Scott</I>: When VGSF launched
its paperback line in the 80s, one of their first titles was Melissa
Scott's <B>Five-Twelfths of Heaven</B>. Since then I've been picking
her books up as quickly as possible. <B>Burning Bright</B> is
her latest, a tale of politics and gaming on a world that lies
between cold-warring empires. Not perhaps Scott at her best, but
certainly a lot better than most current Sf.
<P>
<B>Web Of Angels</B>, <I>John M. Ford</I>: Back into the archives
for an out-of-print first novel. <B>Web of Angels</B> is literate
proto-cyberpunk (as is to be expected fom the erudite Mr Ford).
Shakespearean tragedy across a networked universe reminiscent
of Schutarikul's Inquest and Brunner's <B>Shockwave Rider</B>.
Madness and love: who can ask for more?
<P>
<B>Teach Yourself HTML Web Publishing in 7 Days</B>, <I>Laura
Lemay</I>: This is the (at the moment) indispensible guide to
self-publishing on the Internet. If you have ever fancied weaving
your own corner of the World Wide Web, then this is the book for
you. Of course, if you haven't, then it's complete techno-weenie
gooble-de-gook, but these are the breaks... If you've got the
tech, then take a look at what I've done on the Net - where you'll
probably find this piece...
<P>
<B>Mailbits and Sundry Spotted Acnestoids</B> 
<P>
I went to see <B>Stargate</B> the other day, only to be confronted
by the ultimate Tuckerisation. Was it really our very own Mr Langford
who'd discovered the eponymous device, and did this mean that
the filmmakers' research had included a copy of <B>The Space Eater</B>.
Enquiring minds want to know...
<P>
<I>Tanya</I>: <B>The Awakeners</B>. This was the first Tepper
I read. I still think it's the best. Somehow each time I finish
one of her books I feel quite disppointed. <B>Wild Cards</B> is
rather fun - though I do recommend tracking down Howard Waldrop's
notes for &quot;Thirty Minutes Over Broadway&quot; - that man
does so much work...
<P>
<I>Maureen</I>: It seems that the <B>X-Files</B> is starting to
do what I feared all along: Turn into <B>Dr Who</B>. The last
episode I watched was an intriguing remake of <B>The Green Death</B>.
At least it's becoming Pertwee era Dr Who. Will Sculley be seconded
to UNIT? Oh well, at least Babylon 5 has returned, and I can carry
on working out who is betraying who, and what is <U>really</U>
happening....
<P>
